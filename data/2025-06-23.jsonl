However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter\nsituations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or\nunfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine\nknowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of\ncounterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop\nreasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual\nreasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.\nMoreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill\ncounterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored\nparametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of\ncurrent LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

Our\nconstruction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous\napproaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are\ndistinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied\ncombinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,\ncoined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their\nunfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark\nour algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT\ninstances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find\nthat DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including\nthe complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the\nhardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.\nThe essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure\nbeyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape\nlocal minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for\ngeneralization to other optimization problems."}

The sender generates the\nrequired fields such as amount and fees, where the additional covert data is\nembedded to enhance the channel capacity. Based on GBSF, we design a reversible\ngenerative adversarial network (R-GAN) that utilizes the generative adversarial\nnetwork with a reversible generator to generate the required fields and encode\nadditional covert data into the input noise of the reversible generator. We\nthen explore the performance flaw of R-GAN. To further improve the performance,\nwe propose R-GAN with Counter-intuitive data preprocessing and Custom\nactivation functions, namely CCR-GAN. The counter-intuitive data preprocessing\n(CIDP) mechanism is used to reduce decoding errors in covert data, while it\nincurs gradient explosion for model convergence. The custom activation function\nnamed ClipSigmoid is devised to overcome the problem. Theoretical justification\nfor CIDP and ClipSigmoid is also provided. We also develop a mechanism named\nT2C, which balances capacity and concealment. We conduct experiments using the\ntransaction amount of the Bitcoin mainnet as the required field to verify the\nfeasibility.

While individual requirements can usually be analyzed\nmanually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL\nrequirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers)\nmay efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical\nlimitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal\nconstraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal\nreasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings\nis less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies\nthe satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive\na satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to\ngenerate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used\nto validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the\nperformance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural\nlanguage into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for\nPython-based checkers.

Audit logs provide a detailed and chronological record of all\nactivities in the system. Unfortunately, K8s auditing suffers from several\npractical limitations: it generates large volumes of data continuously, as all\ncomponents within the cluster interact and respond to user actions.

These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT\nidentifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion\nin the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the\ninput. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an\nopposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal\nsignal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful\nattack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple\nsampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source\nGPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.\nBesides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against\npopular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'."}

This is the basis for\none of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware\ndesigners to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally\n\"equivalent\" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This\nspecification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors\ngenerally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we\nadvocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement.\nWe introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient\nexecution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that\nubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for\ndecades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use\nnon-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is\nsingle specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional\ncorrectness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture. We introduce action\nskipping refinement, a new type of refinement and we describe how our notions\nof refinement can be decomposed into properties that are more amenable to\nautomated verification using the the concept of shared-resource commitment\nrefinement maps. We do this in the context of formal, fully executable bit- and\ncycle-accurate models of an ISA and a microprocessor. Finally, we show how\nlight-weight formal methods based on property-based testing can be used to\nidentify transient execution bugs."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

The\nresearch demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the\nimportance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies,\nconsidering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate\nverification methodologies."}

In\nparticular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level\nissue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been\nsignificant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving\nsuch issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately\nsuspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper\nunderstanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.\nConsequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user\nissue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,\ncode, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -\nidentifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through\na novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant\ncontext, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)\nisolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)\nleverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that\nproposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant\nfixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our\nmethodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark\nbeating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of\n7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.\nWe note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring\nmulti-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that\nincorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust\nand semantically consistent repairs."}

We argue that firms must tag and review every\nAI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or\non-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that\ncatch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and\naccuracy."}

Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness\nof security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve\nthe assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce\nFPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets\nextracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project.\nOur results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as\nChain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection.\nNotably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark\ndataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different\nLLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering\nfive SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The\nbest LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while\ncombining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to\n38.46%.

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair\nsystems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source\nPython repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench\nVerified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing\nsolutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed\ndocumentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain\nunclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all\nsubmissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries)\nleaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as\nsubmitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our\nfindings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7),\nthe presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base\nspanning from individual developers to large tech companies."}
