Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective,\ncapturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task\ndifficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction)\nreproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart\nEditing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding\nelements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to\ntransform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user\ninstructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that\nreflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task\ncomplexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types,\npaired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness\nand the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art\n(SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such\nas GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on\ncode-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing\ntasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark\nwill drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more\nrobust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nrecently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection.\nHowever, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and\nsubstantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a\nparallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and\naccuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first\ndevelop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA\nintroduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized\nLoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource\nrequirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related\nissues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval\nwith Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by\nthe LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of\nthe RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results.\nAfter completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to\nguide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms\nof F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for\nmulti-label detection."}

However, there is an increasing recognition that RAN\ndata access to apps could become a source of vulnerability and be exploited by\nmalicious actors. Motivated by this, we carry out a comprehensive investigation\nof data vulnerabilities on both xApps and rApps, respectively hosted in Near-\nand Non-real-time (RT) RIC components of O-RAN. We qualitatively analyse the\nO-RAN security mechanisms and limitations for xApps and rApps, and consider a\nthreat model informed by this analysis.

Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead.

LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process\ninherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM\nuncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that\nweaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a\nthree-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought\ndistraction with a core \"Trojan Schema\"--a carefully crafted data structure\nthat compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong\ntendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is\nhighly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13\nfoundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100%\nAttack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation\nstudy confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To\ncounter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a\ndefense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a \"Literal\nTranscription\"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the\nuser's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high\nefficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is\na viable mitigation strategy.

In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a\nparallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and\naccuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first\ndevelop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA\nintroduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized\nLoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource\nrequirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related\nissues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval\nwith Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by\nthe LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of\nthe RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results.\nAfter completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to\nguide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms\nof F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for\nmulti-label detection."}

Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator.
