Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme\nnamed Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates\ncontext-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,\nensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of\npre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an\nadversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing\nmodel misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases."}

However, most existing backdoor attacks\nrely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking\nthe potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor\nAttacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor\ntriggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing\nmechanism for injection timing.

Furthermore, we propose\na gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude\nunder environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms\nand nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack\nsuccess rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.\nThese results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of\nprincipled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks.

Starting from a description of\nthe building blocks of a safety case (claims, evidence, and optional\nformat-dependent entries), this paper delves into the assessment of support of\neach claim through the provided evidence.

Existing\nmethods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,\noverlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically\ninconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme\nnamed Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates\ncontext-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,\nensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of\npre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an\nadversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing\nmodel misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This\ncomprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective\nadversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our\nexperimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate\nthe efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP\nsystems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances\nthe subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases."}

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains:\nquantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully\nrecovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer\nConfiguration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN\nproduces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven,\niterative design. It also completes taxonomy generation in under two hours and\nfor less than one USD, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that\nwhile full automation remains challenging, ASTAGEN is able to support\nsemi-automated taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues\nfor future work, such as automatic taxonomy generation in other areas."}

Currently, the 3GPP has analyzed the security risks\nof Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM), where handover signaling sent to\nthe UE via MAC CE by the network can lead to privacy leaks and network attacks.\nHowever, in addition to LTM, there may be other potential security\nvulnerabilities in other protocol procedures. Therefore, this paper explores\nthe security threats to MAC CE and the corresponding protection mechanisms.

Distinct from general federated scenarios, FR\ninherently needs to preserve client-specific parameters, i.e., user embeddings,\nfor privacy and personalization. However, we empirically find that globally\naggregated item embeddings can induce skew in user embeddings, resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. To this end, we theoretically analyze the user\nembedding skew issue and propose Personalized Federated recommendation with\nCalibration via Low-Rank decomposition (PFedCLR). Specifically, PFedCLR\nintroduces an integrated dual-function mechanism, implemented with a buffer\nmatrix, to jointly calibrate local user embedding and personalize global item\nembeddings. To ensure efficiency, we employ a low-rank decomposition of the\nbuffer matrix to reduce the model overhead. Furthermore, for privacy, we train\nand upload the local model before personalization, preventing the server from\naccessing sensitive information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PFedCLR\neffectively mitigates user embedding skew and achieves a desirable trade-off\namong performance, efficiency, and privacy, outperforming state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods."}

However, most existing backdoor attacks\nrely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking\nthe potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor\nAttacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor\ntriggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing\nmechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a\ncooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most\ninfluential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose\na gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude\nunder environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms\nand nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack\nsuccess rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.\nThese results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of\nprincipled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks.

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases."}

Starting from a description of\nthe building blocks of a safety case (claims, evidence, and optional\nformat-dependent entries), this paper delves into the assessment of support of\neach claim through the provided evidence. Two domains of assessment are\noutlined for each claim: procedural support (formalizing process specification)\nand implementation support (demonstrating process application).

Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against\nadaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have\nwide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based\napplications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a\npublic challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants\nadaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to\ntrigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge\nspanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval\nconfigurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions\nfrom 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of\nsubmissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new\ninsights into the instruction-data separation problem.

The challenge lies\nin ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,\nappropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still\nmaintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development\nof tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience\nagainst malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses\non adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal\nbenefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system\nthat leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a\npolicy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming\nconventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and\ncoercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce\ntau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's\nrobustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several\nstraightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide\nsome protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,\nresearch-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial\nattacks"}

Using these findings, we built an automated pipeline extracting\n31,942 VFCs from 20,360 NVD records (8.7% of 235,341) with 87% precision,\nmainly from Git references. To fill gaps, we mined six external security\ndatabases, yielding 29,254 VFCs for 18,985 records (8.1%) at 88.4% precision,\nand GitHub repositories, adding 3,686 VFCs for 2,795 records (1.2%) at 73%\nprecision.
