While AI agents\noffer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,\nlimiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a\nself-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA\nrepresents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and\ngrow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical\ndiscovery."}

Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities.

While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases.

Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nRLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process\ngraphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining\ntheory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential\nand non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive\nevaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference\nlatency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical\nsolution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications.

We\nbelieve open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where\nco-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific\nprogress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we\ndevelop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in\nmodel-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We\nprovide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved\nversion of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7\nsecurity benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic\ninstruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,\nincluding tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general\ninstruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves\nstate-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable\nutility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense."}

Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition.

Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are\ncurrently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We\nbelieve open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where\nco-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific\nprogress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we\ndevelop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in\nmodel-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We\nprovide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved\nversion of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7\nsecurity benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic\ninstruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,\nincluding tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general\ninstruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves\nstate-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable\nutility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense."}

However, LLMs could evade monitoring through\nsteganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to\nbetter understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:\npassing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current\nmodels are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor\nnoticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given\nadditional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating\non what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models\ncan perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This\nincludes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,\nincluding encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely\nhide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our\nresults indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.\nWhile these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed\nmonitors at present, this could change in the future."}
