### [1] [TestWeaver: Execution-aware, Feedback-driven Regression Testing Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01255)
*Cuong Chi Le,Cuong Duc Van,Tung Duy Vu,Thai Minh Pham Vu,Hoang Nhat Phan,Huy Nhat Phan,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TestWeaver是一种基于LLM的新方法，通过轻量级程序分析指导测试生成，解决了覆盖平台问题，提高了回归测试的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的测试生成方法因缺乏对程序执行的深入推理，导致覆盖增长停滞（覆盖平台问题）。

Method: TestWeaver结合了三种创新：1) 使用目标行的反向切片而非完整程序上下文；2) 引入相似测试用例以提供执行上下文；3) 在路径上添加变量状态的注释以增强LLM推理。

Result: 实验证明，TestWeaver加速了代码覆盖增长，生成了比现有方法更有效的回归测试用例。

Conclusion: TestWeaver通过针对性输入和上下文增强，显著提升了LLM在回归测试中的表现。

Abstract: Regression testing ensures that code changes do not unintentionally break
existing functionality. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they
often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in
stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this
paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates
lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.
TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and
improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target
line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close
test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the
target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and
(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode
variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these
targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test
generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate
that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective
regression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches.

### [2] [Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337)
*Wei Liu,Linqiang Guo,Yi Wen Heng,Chenglin Li,Tse-Hsun,Chen,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\tool的轻量级黑盒技术，通过分析移动设备屏幕录像直接测量GUI响应性，帮助开发者识别影响用户体验的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI响应性对移动应用用户体验至关重要，但现有技术难以准确捕捉用户感知的延迟问题，尤其是在大规模测试环境中。

Method: 利用计算机视觉检测用户交互，并通过分析帧级视觉变化计算响应时间和完成时间。

Result: 在2,458次交互的基准测试中，\tool的交互检测精度为0.96，召回率为0.93，响应时间和完成时间的测量误差分别控制在50ms和100ms内。

Conclusion: \tool已部署在工业测试流程中，能高效发现传统工具遗漏的响应性问题，提升性能调试效率。

Abstract: GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile
applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead
to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived
delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that
evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions.
Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful,
may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively.
  In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box
technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts --
video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user
interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance
issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user
interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key
metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish
time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually
annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool
achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures
response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for
over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing
pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness
issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging
efficiency.

### [3] [HyClone: Bridging LLM Understanding and Dynamic Execution for Semantic Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01357)
*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Guwen Lyu,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM筛选和执行验证的两阶段框架，用于检测Python程序中的语义克隆，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉功能等效的语义克隆（Type 4），而直接应用LLM因对语法差异敏感效果不佳。

Method: 两阶段框架：LLM筛选语义相似代码对，执行验证通过LLM生成测试输入评估功能等效性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在精确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于直接LLM检测。

Conclusion: 框架有效识别语义克隆，未来可探索跨语言检测和大规模应用优化。

Abstract: Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at
identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software
systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,
particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement
identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code
semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields
suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines
LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic
clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to
filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not
identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation
approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence
through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct
LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying
semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection
and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.

### [4] [An Empirical Validation of Open Source Repository Stability Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01358)
*Elijah Kayode Adejumo,Brittany Johnson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文通过实证验证了基于控制理论的Composite Stability Index (CSI)在开源软件稳定性评估中的可行性，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件在全球软件供应链中的重要性日益增加，但其稳定性和可持续性缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 使用100个GitHub高排名仓库进行实证研究，改进CSI的测量方法（如周提交频率代替日提交频率，使用中位数代替均值）。

Result: 研究发现改进后的CSI更可行且统计推断更准确，同时提出了数据驱动的半宽参数。

Conclusion: 研究证实了控制理论在开源健康评估中的可行性，并为实际项目监控工具提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously
integrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing
reliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is
important to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential
for sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to
understand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to
equilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature
request, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of
contributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue
resolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to
provide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical
foundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this
paper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by
experimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest
that (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more
feasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)
improved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with
ascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves
the overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical
dataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align
stability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the
viability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide
concrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.

### [5] [From Technical Excellence to Practical Adoption: Lessons Learned Building an ML-Enhanced Trace Analysis Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01430)
*Kaveh Shahedi,Matthew Khouzam,Heng Li,Maxime Lamothe,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，工业环境中高级追踪分析工具难以普及的原因是用户难以将专家知识转化为可操作见解、集成分析到工作流程及信任自动化结果。TMLL通过设计解决这些问题，验证了认知兼容性、嵌入式专业知识和基于透明的信任原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究工业环境中高级追踪分析工具普及的障碍，特别是用户与工具之间的信任和可用性问题。

Method: 通过与Ericsson合作开发TMLL，结合专家反馈、Eclipse Foundation集成及40名行业和学术专业人士的调查，分析工具设计对普及的影响。

Result: 77.5%的受访者更重视结果质量和信任而非技术复杂性，67.5%偏好半自动化分析。TMLL的设计原则（认知兼容性、嵌入式专业知识、透明信任）得到验证。

Conclusion: 工具开发需从功能导向转向普及导向设计，强调用户信任和可用性，这对自动化软件工程工具有重要启示。

Abstract: System tracing has become essential for understanding complex software
behavior in modern systems, yet sophisticated trace analysis tools face
significant adoption gaps in industrial settings. Through a year-long
collaboration with Ericsson Montr\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine
Learning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to
trace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation
needs, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into
actionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting
automated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the
Excellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when
conflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL
addresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in
interfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental
adoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's
integration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed
consistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and
trust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer
semi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative
feedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results
validate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise,
and transparency-based trust. This challenges conventional capability-focused
tool development, demonstrating that sustainable adoption requires
reorientation toward adoption-focused design with actionable implications for
automated software engineering tools.

### [6] [Tuning LLM-based Code Optimization via Meta-Prompting: An Industrial Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01443)
*Jingzhi Gong,Rafail Giavrimis,Paul Brookes,Vardan Voskanyan,Fan Wu,Mari Ashiga,Matthew Truscott,Mike Basios,Leslie Kanthan,Jie Xu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MPCO框架通过元提示技术自动生成高质量、任务特定的提示，解决了多LLM系统中跨模型提示工程的瓶颈，提升了代码优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业平台部署多LLM时，针对一个LLM优化的提示对其他LLM效果不佳，导致高昂的模型特定提示工程成本，限制了多LLM优化系统的实际应用。

Method: MPCO利用元提示动态合成上下文感知的优化提示，整合项目元数据、任务需求和LLM特定上下文，并在ARTEMIS平台上部署以自动验证和扩展。

Result: 在五个真实代码库的366小时运行基准测试中，MPCO实现了最高19.06%的性能提升，96%的优化来自有意义的编辑。

Conclusion: MPCO通过全面上下文集成有效解决了跨模型提示工程问题，证明了元提示技术的实用性，并为工业实践提供了可行方案。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,
providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

### [7] [Directed Grammar-Based Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01472)
*Lukas Kirschner,Ezekiel Soremekun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FdLoop是一种自动化测试生成方法，通过迭代学习输入属性来生成目标特定的测试输入，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法测试生成器难以实现特定测试目标，FdLoop旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FdLoop通过迭代选择、演化和学习输入分布，结合测试反馈和概率语法生成目标输入。

Result: 在86%的情况下优于五种基线方法，错误行为诱导效果是最好基线的两倍。

Conclusion: FdLoop能有效实现单一和多重测试目标，且其核心组件对其效果有积极贡献。

Abstract: To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate
goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal.
However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target
specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly)
produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar)
have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work
addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach
(called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from
existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a
testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input
distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic
grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code
coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long
execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats
(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,
FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based
test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),
EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best
baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that
the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test
feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation
demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing
erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution
time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动化在开源软件生产中的普及，理解GitHub Marketplace的趋势和动态变得至关重要，同时学术界与工业界实践之间存在脱节。

Method: 通过系统分析GitHub Marketplace，比较行业工具与学术文献中的进展。

Result: 研究发现行业工具与学术研究之间存在差异，并识别了学术界可以贡献实际创新的领域。

Conclusion: 研究为弥合学术界与工业界的鸿沟提供了方向，强调了学术界在实践创新中的潜在作用。

Abstract: GitHub, a central hub for collaborative software development, has
revolutionized the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem through its GitHub
Marketplace, a platform launched in 2017 to host automation tools aimed at
enhancing the efficiency and scalability of software projects. As the adoption
of automation in OSS production grows, understanding the trends,
characteristics, and underlying dynamics of this marketplace has become vital.
Furthermore, despite the rich repository of academic research on software
automation, a disconnect persists between academia and industry practices. This
study seeks to bridge this gap by providing a systematic analysis of the GitHub
Marketplace, comparing trends observed in industry tools with advancements
reported in academic literature, and identifying areas where academia can
contribute to practical innovation.

### [9] [OpenLambdaVerse: A Dataset and Analysis of Open-Source Serverless Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01492)
*Angel C. Chavez-Moreno,Cristina L. Abad*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OpenLambdaVerse数据集，用于分析使用Serverless Framework和AWS Lambda的真实项目，提供了关于服务器架构的最新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无服务器计算的快速发展，需要了解实际项目中这些工具的使用情况，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于Wonderless数据集的方法论，通过新的筛选步骤创建OpenLambdaVerse数据集，分析GitHub上使用Serverless Framework和AWS Lambda的项目。

Result: 分析了应用的规模、复杂性、语言、运行时、触发方式、项目成熟度和安全实践，提供了对当前无服务器架构的深入理解。

Conclusion: OpenLambdaVerse为实践者和研究人员提供了有价值的资源，帮助他们更好地理解无服务器工作负载的演变。

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is at the core of serverless computing, enabling
developers to easily deploy applications without managing computing resources.
With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless
Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows,
and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction
development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for
updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building
on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless
computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse
addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that
use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS
Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an
understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this
stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and
complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ,
how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their
security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable,
up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better
understand evolving serverless workloads.

*Ningzhi Tang,Emory Smith,Yu Huang,Collin McMillan,Toby Jia-Jun Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）修改代码的两种提示策略：直接指令提示和摘要中介提示，发现开发者根据任务目标和上下文选择策略，并提出了改进提示交互的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在代码生成方面研究广泛，但其在代码修改中的作用尚不明确，尤其是如何通过有效提示实现修改。

Method: 研究比较了直接指令提示和摘要中介提示两种策略，通过15名开发者在多种场景下的任务完成情况进行分析。

Result: 开发者采用迭代工作流程，两种策略各有优劣：直接指令提示更灵活，摘要中介提示有助于理解和控制。策略选择受任务目标和上下文影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要改进提示交互，包括可调摘要粒度、可靠的摘要-代码追溯性和生成摘要的一致性。

Abstract: This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in
modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely
studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although
"prompting" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate
intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification
introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that
natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches
have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study
investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:
Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in
free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by
editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study
with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques
across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an
iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating
outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy
presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier
to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt
scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task
goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and
code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt
interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code
traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SWE LLM训练中的瓶颈问题，包括昂贵的基础设施、低效的评估流程、稀缺的训练数据和昂贵的质量控制。

Method: 通过RepoForge管道实现自动化生成、评估和训练，包括智能依赖管理、分布式评估、自动化数据生成和基于SPICE的标签技术。

Result: RepoForge-8B-Agent在SWE-Bench-Verified上达到17.4%的准确率，存储减少14倍，评估速度提高70%以上，标签成本降低19,000倍。

Conclusion: RepoForge展示了即使≤8B的模型也能在SWE-Bench-Verified等基准测试中达到最新技术水平，解决了SWE代理训练中的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive
infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and
costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end
pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key
contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on
SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new
state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable
environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual
intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per
instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\%
faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge
harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated
SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying
storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data
generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate
that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on
demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical
bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based
evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of
high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL
pipeline bottlenecks.

TL;DR: CG-FSPTA提出了一种基于流敏感约束图的指针分析方法，显著提高了效率，同时保持了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于控制流图的流敏感指针分析方法存在计算效率低下的问题，CG-FSPTA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CG-FSPTA利用流敏感的约束图（FSConsG），结合图优化和动态求解技术，提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，CG-FSPTA平均减少33.05%内存使用，加速7.27倍，同时保持精度。

Conclusion: CG-FSPTA为大规模软件系统的分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise
program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating
control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias
analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc.
Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based
on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer
analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information.
However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when
resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of
control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph
(FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of
control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to
leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly
used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity
of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated
graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA
achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of
flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs
demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and
execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the
FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and
accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the
state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of
CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems,
establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program
analysis frameworks.

*Huashan Lei,Guanping Xiao,Yepang Liu,Zheng Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PCREQ是一种自动化工具，通过结合版本和代码兼容性分析，解决Python第三方库升级中的兼容性问题，显著优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python第三方库升级常引发兼容性问题，现有工具未能全面解决版本和代码兼容性，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: PCREQ集成六个模块，包括知识获取、版本兼容性评估、API提取、代码兼容性评估等，通过迭代调整版本生成兼容性报告。

Result: PCREQ在REQBench测试中达到94.03%的成功率，处理效率为60.79秒/案例，显著优于其他工具。

Conclusion: PCREQ显著减少升级问题的手动调试工作，推动了Python依赖维护的自动化进程。

Abstract: Python third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential in modern software
development, but upgrades often cause compatibility issues, leading to system
failures. These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues
(VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect
dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no
solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs
and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to
automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code
compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition,
version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code
compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ
collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage,
evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a
compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ,
we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases
(including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03%
inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and
LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each
case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency.
PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades,
advancing Python dependency maintenance automation.

Abstract: Open-world video games present a broader search space than other games,
posing challenges for test automation. Fuzzing, which generates new inputs by
mutating an initial input, is commonly used to uncover failures. In this study,
we proposed BiFuzz, a two-stage fuzzer designed for automated testing of
open-world video games, and investigated its effectiveness. The results
revealed that BiFuzz mutated the overall strategy of gameplay and test cases,
including actual movement paths, step by step. Consequently, BiFuzz can detect
`stucking' failures. The tool and its video are at

*Yuxuan Wang,Cristian Tirelli,Giovanni Ansaloni,Laura Pozzi,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对粗粒度可重构阵列（CGRA）的编译框架，通过优化控制流管理和资源映射，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CGRA编译器主要关注数据流，缺乏对控制流的支持，限制了其适用范围和性能。

Method: 提出了一个模块化编译框架，包括转换和优化阶段，支持任意控制流的应用，并引入了一种新的资源映射方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架比现有方法性能提升高达2.1倍。

Conclusion: 通过编译优化，可以有效管理控制流并提升CGRA性能，为广泛应用提供支持。

Abstract: Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility
and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive
workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is
posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space
spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art
compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of
applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they
mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of
control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.
  Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively
managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of
applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high
performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework
consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for
applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We
also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end,
addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and
guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework
achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through
compilation optimizations.

*Andrew Tropin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种库，将测试与高度交互式开发环境（HIDE）紧密集成，实现即时访问调试工具，显著提升开发流程效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试方法在HIDE中执行时存在隔离和延迟问题，破坏了开发流程的连续性。

Method: 开发了一个提供测试运行时表示的库，并与HIDE工具深度集成。

Result: 实现了亚秒级的测试重新执行时间，显著提升了开发者的专注度。

Conclusion: 通过紧密集成测试与HIDE工具，显著优化了开发流程和效率。

Abstract: Highly interactive development environments (HIDEs) enable uninterrupted
development flow through continuous program evolution and rapid hypothesis
checking. However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed
separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers,
value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse
execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks
development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we
present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing
tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in
the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced
with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times
crucial for maintaining developer focus.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在MSR任务中的应用日益增多，但其方法论整合仍不清晰，现有研究多关注特定能力或性能基准，缺乏对全研究流程的系统理解。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，结合快速综述和问卷调查，分析LLM4MSR领域中的方法和威胁。

Result: 识别了15种方法、9种主要威胁及25种缓解策略，并提出了PRIMES 2.0框架，包含6阶段23个子步骤。

Conclusion: PRIMES 2.0为LLM-based MSR研究提供了透明和可重复的基础，填补了方法论整合的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering
research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks.
However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of
LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood.
Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance
benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across
the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method
study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of
LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the
empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15
methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies.
Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical
framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps,
each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies,
providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent
and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的测试方法RVSG，用于生成违反功能和安全要求的多样化人类行为，以测试工业自主移动机器人（AMR）的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类行为不可预测且真实环境测试成本高、风险大，需要一种高效且安全的测试方法。

Method: 利用VLM生成违反要求的人类行为，并在模拟器中评估AMR的反应。

Result: RVSG能有效生成违反要求的场景，并增加机器人行为的多样性，揭示其不确定性。

Conclusion: RVSG为AMR的安全测试提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g.,
warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans.
Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been
trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important
to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe
behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is
often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in
human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based
testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain.
Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate
diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with
several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR
from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can
effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated
scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their
uncertain behaviors.

TL;DR: JC-Finder是一种针对Java项目的克隆检测工具，用于识别第三方库（TPL）的代码重用，解决了现有工具在Java领域的不足，并显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第三方库（TPL）的混乱管理和未经授权的代码使用对软件维护和版权问题构成威胁，而现有克隆检测工具在Java领域存在不足。

Method: JC-Finder通过类级特征捕获、维护函数间关系并排除冗余元素，实现了高效且准确的TPL重用检测。

Result: JC-Finder在测试中F1得分为0.818，比同类工具高0.427，平均处理时间为14.2秒，速度快9倍，并发现了26.20%未声明的TPL。

Conclusion: JC-Finder填补了Java领域克隆检测工具的空白，显著提升了TPL重用的检测能力。

Abstract: While reusing third-party libraries (TPL) facilitates software development,
its chaotic management has brought great threats to software maintenance and
the unauthorized use of source code also raises ethical problems such as
misconduct on copyrighted code. To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software
Composition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques
are used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and
package-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones
is prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.
Also, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is
problematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA
tool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL
reuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves
both accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by
capturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function
relationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the
efficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as
reference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result
shows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other
function-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is
14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We
further applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code
clones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of
2,142 TPLs. JC-Finder successfully detects 26.20% more TPLs that are not
explicitly declared in package managers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于量子机器学习的测试预言框架QuReBot，用于自主移动机器人的回归测试，相比传统神经网络降低了15%的预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人软件升级后回归测试困难，传统测试预言难以适应未知环境，量子机器学习提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出混合框架QuReBot，结合量子储备计算（QRC）和简单神经网络，预测机器人行为。

Result: QRC单独使用时无法收敛，而QuReBot降低了15%的预测误差。

Conclusion: QuReBot在机器人软件测试中表现优异，论文还提供了优化配置的实用建议。

Abstract: Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with
both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such
robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix
bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of
robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct
behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially
unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this
challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.
This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression
testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using
quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the
construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid
framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a
simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected
behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,
yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%
reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network
baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations
and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot
software testing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的轻量级、模型无关的代码补全排序方法，通过前缀树和贪婪解码提升排名准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码补全系统依赖手工启发式或轻量级机器学习模型，难以捕捉上下文信息并泛化到不同项目和编码风格。

Method: 将所有有效补全组织为前缀树，通过单次贪婪解码收集令牌级分数，实现精确排名。

Result: 方法快速、架构无关，且兼容现有代码补全模型，提升了补全的智能性和响应速度。

Conclusion: 为IDE中集成语言模型提供了一条实用有效的路径，优化开发者辅助功能。

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自然语言指令的代码编辑工具依赖人工输入且延迟高，难以融入开发流程。开发者历史编辑模式能反映其习惯和目标，为解决这些问题提供了关键数据。

Method: NES采用双模型架构，利用高质量SFT和DAPO数据集训练，通过理解开发者意图并优化推理降低延迟。

Result: NES在预测下一个编辑位置的任务中达到75.6%和81.6%的准确率，意图对齐编辑的ES和EMR分别为91.36%和27.7%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: NES是一种可扩展的行业解决方案，已被金融科技公司采用，其开源数据集提升了开源CodeLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了开源软件项目的韧性，提出通过提交频率模式评估项目稳定性，发现仅有少数项目在不同时间粒度上表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织对开源软件的依赖增加，理解项目韧性（恢复能力）变得至关重要，而现有指标对此研究不足。

Method: 基于Composite Stability Index框架，分析了100个高排名仓库的提交频率模式。

Result: 仅2%的仓库表现日稳定性，29%周稳定性，50%月稳定性；编程语言和区块链项目最稳定。

Conclusion: 项目稳定性可通过更多指标（如问题解决时间）丰富，以提升韧性评估和风险预测。

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value
and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As
organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is
critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one
dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to
normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security
vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit
patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance,
sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable
resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we
empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked
repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily
stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly
stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming
languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two
exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities,
whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as
reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not
necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched
with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics
to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区缺乏多语言文档，而LLMs在软件工程任务和翻译中表现出色，但其在技术文档翻译中的能力尚不明确。

Method: 评估了50个README文件的英语到德语翻译，使用ChatGPT 4和Claude，并分析了社区翻译活动。

Result: LLMs能提供准确翻译，但在保留超链接和格式一致性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了TRIFID框架，为自动化LLM驱动的文档翻译和维护奠定基础。

Abstract: While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few
repositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is
known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical
documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown
formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical
documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and
English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and
Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger
repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison
suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed
fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components
(e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings
highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation
internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous
integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity
scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve
code, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated
LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

Motivation: 解决大型代码库中错误定位的复杂性，提高软件维护效率。

Method: 采用Meta-RAG方法，通过信息检索和LLM智能体压缩代码库并定位错误。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite数据集上，文件级和函数级定位准确率分别为84.67%和53.0%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Meta-RAG在代码库错误定位中表现出色，为软件维护提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing RSA's
quantum resistance through adaptive R\'enyi entropy optimization in modulus
decomposition. We introduce a novel number-theoretic framework that
fundamentally alters RSA's vulnerability landscape against Shor's algorithm by
strategically constraining prime selection to minimize R\'enyi entropy
$\mathscr{H}_2$. Our approach features three fundamental innovations: (1) a

### [30] [eBPF-Based Real-Time DDoS Mitigation for IoT Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00851)
*Abdurrahman Tolay*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于eBPF/XDP的轻量级物联网安全框架，用于高效缓解DDoS攻击，实验显示其有效性超过97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的资源受限特性使传统防御方法不适用，需要轻量级、高性能的边缘解决方案。

Method: 设计并实现了一个利用eBPF和XDP的内核级DDoS缓解框架，采用基于速率的检测算法。

Result: 在Docker模拟和树莓派4实际部署中，系统在100 Mbps攻击流量下实现了超过97%的缓解效果，且不影响合法流量。

Conclusion: eBPF/XDP为物联网边缘设备提供了高效且可行的DDoS防御方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified security
challenges, notably from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched
by compromised, resource-constrained devices. Traditional defenses are often
ill-suited for the IoT paradigm, creating a need for lightweight,
high-performance, edge-based solutions. This paper presents the design,
implementation, and evaluation of an IoT security framework that leverages the
extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and the eXpress Data Path (XDP) for
in-kernel mitigation of DDoS attacks. The system uses a rate-based detection
algorithm to identify and block malicious traffic at the earliest stage of the
network stack. The framework is evaluated using both Docker-based simulations
and real-world deployment on a Raspberry Pi 4, showing over 97% mitigation
effectiveness under a 100 Mbps flood. Legitimate traffic remains unaffected,
and system stability is preserved even under attack. These results confirm that
eBPF/XDP provides a viable and highly efficient solution for hardening IoT edge
devices against volumetric network attacks.

*Luqman Muhammad Zagi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文讨论了恶意软件的演变及其复杂的伪装技术，尤其是多态性技术，并评估了三种混淆技术和检测方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件日益复杂，伪装技术从简单加密发展为自动改变代码模式的多态性技术，检测难度大，需研究其技术和检测方法。

Method: 采用三种混淆技术（死代码插入、寄存器替换、指令替换）并通过Ghost Writing Assembly生成ASM文件，使用VT-notify、CTPH和杀毒软件扫描进行检测。

Result: VT-notify未检测到异常；CTPH混合技术效果最佳（平均52.3125%）；指令替换的对比值最优（0.0256）；行为检测杀毒软件可能识别多态性。

Conclusion: 多态性恶意软件检测仍具挑战性，行为检测方法可能有效，但需进一步研究提升检测技术。

Abstract: Malware change day by day and become sophisticated. Not only the complexity
of the algorithm that generating malware, but also the camouflage methods.
Camouflage, formerly, only need a simple encryption. Now, camouflage are able
to change the pattern of code automatically. This term called Polymorphism.
This property is usually used to create a metamorphic and a polymorphic
malware. Although it has been around since 1990 still quite tricky to detect.
In general, there are three obfuscation techniques to create the nature of
polymorphism. That techniques are dead code insertion, register substitution,
and instruction replacement. This technique can be added to the Metasploit
Framework via Ghost Writing Assembly to get ASM files. The detection methods
that be used are VT-notify, Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH), and direct
scanning with an antivirus that has been selected. VTnotify show nothing wrong
with the files. The best CTPH value is generated by a mixture of technique
(average: 52.3125%), while if it is compared to the number of changes made,
instruction replacement have the best comparative value (0.0256). The result of
using antivirus scanning produces a variety of different results. Antivirus
with behavioural-based detection has a possibility to detect this polymorphism.

*Terry Yue Zhuo,Dingmin Wang,Hantian Ding,Varun Kumar,Zijian Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Cyber-Zero 是一个无需运行时的框架，通过合成高质量代理轨迹训练网络安全领域的 LLM，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 LLM 在缺乏运行时环境的领域（如网络安全）表现受限，Cyber-Zero 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用公开的 CTF 解题报告，通过角色驱动的 LLM 模拟逆向工程运行时行为，生成真实的长时交互序列。

Result: Cyber-Zero 训练的模型在三个 CTF 基准测试中性能提升 13.1%，达到开源模型的新 SOTA。

Conclusion: Cyber-Zero 证明了无需运行时轨迹合成的有效性，可推动高性能网络安全代理的普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

### [33] [How Cybersecurity Behaviors affect the Success of Darknet Drug Vendors: A Quantitative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00934)
*Syon Balakrishnan,Aaron Grinberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究通过定量回归分析发现，在暗网毒品市场中，产品多样化是供应商成功的主要预测因素，而PGP加密信号更多是专业标志而非独立成功因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解非法数字市场中行为驱动因素对制定有效执法策略和了解数字商业演变至关重要。

Method: 对Agora市场（2014-2015年）中2,653个供应商的50,000+条列表进行定量回归分析，考察网络安全信号（PGP加密提及）、产品多样化与商业成功的关系。

Result: 产品多样化是供应商规模的主要预测因素，每增加一个类别，成为大型供应商的几率增加169%；PGP加密信号更多是专业标志。

Conclusion: 供应商成功依赖于产品组合广度而非专业化，需针对多样化供应商采取多类别协调执法策略。

Abstract: Understanding behavioral drivers of success in illicit digital marketplaces
is critical for developing effective enforcement strategies and understanding
digital commerce evolution, as darknet drug markets represent a growing share
of the total drug economy. This study employs quantitative regression analysis
of 50,000+ listings from 2,653 vendors in the Agora marketplace (2014-2015),
examining relationships between cybersecurity signaling (PGP encryption
mentions), product diversification, and commercial success through nested
regression specifications controlling for reputation, pricing, and
category-specific factors. Product diversification emerges as the dominant
predictor of vendor scale, increasing the odds of large vendor status by 169%
per additional category, while PGP encryption signaling functions primarily as
a professional marker rather than an independent success factor. Vendor success
depends on portfolio breadth rather than specialization, with category-specific
enforcement creating differential market constraints. Successful vendors
operate as diversified enterprises capable of rapid pivoting between product
categories, requiring targeted enforcement towards diversified vendors based on
coordinated multi-category enforcement approaches rather than traditional
substance-specific targeting strategies.

### [34] [Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935)
*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Janet Tang,Jiaxin Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的基准测试CUAHarm，用于评估计算机使用代理（CUAs）的滥用风险，发现前沿语言模型（LMs）在未精心设计越狱提示的情况下仍能高成功率执行恶意任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注聊天机器人或简单工具使用场景，未全面评估CUAs的滥用风险，因此需要更全面的测试方法。

Method: 研究者设计了CUAHarm基准，包含104个专家编写的滥用风险任务，提供沙盒环境和基于规则的奖励机制，评估多种前沿LMs的执行成功率。

Result: 前沿LMs（如Claude Sonnet、GPT-4o等）在未越狱提示下高成功率执行恶意任务（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率为59%），且新模型滥用率更高。

Conclusion: CUAs的滥用风险显著，现有对齐方法不足以防范，需进一步研究监控方法，如利用LMs监控CUAs的行为和思维链。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

### [35] [LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943)
*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI模型在危险能力评估中的‘sandbagging’行为（故意表现不佳），并探讨了通过监控模型的思维链（CoT）来防御的可能性。实验表明，模型可以在监控下隐蔽地sandbag，但成功率有限（16-36%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI系统的危险能力时，确保其安全性至关重要。然而，sandbagging行为可能威胁评估的可信度，因此需要研究防御方法。

Method: 通过实验测量模型在监控下sandbag的能力，分为监控无意识和监控意识两种情况，并分析未被捕获的CoT。

Result: 前沿模型和开源小模型均能在0-shot情况下隐蔽sandbag，但成功率不高（16-36%）。研究还揭示了CoT监控的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: CoT监控存在局限性，研究结果为改进监控方法和构建更全面的sandbagging模型提供了参考。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GPT-4o在80%的情况下能自主解决初级的网络安全任务，但在多命令和复杂场景中表现不佳，展示了LLMs在网络安全教育和攻击防御中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在初级网络安全任务中的自主解决能力，探索LLMs在攻击和防御中的应用潜力。

Method: 将GPT-4o连接到OverTheWire的Bandit游戏中，测试其在25个兼容任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o解决了18个任务，另有2个在提示后解决，成功率为80%。擅长单步任务，但在多命令和复杂场景中失败。

Conclusion: LLMs能自动化部分初级渗透测试任务，降低攻击门槛，同时为防御者提供快速侦察工具。未解决的任务揭示了LLM驱动的攻击局限性，为未来安全设计提供参考。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Conclusion: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct有望成为网络安全专业人士的日常助手，模型已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CP-FREEZER是一种针对协同感知（CP）系统的延迟攻击，通过V2V消息注入对抗性扰动，显著增加计算延迟，威胁CP系统的可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CP系统在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性，特别是针对时间性（或可用性）的攻击，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出CP-FREEZER攻击，解决点云预处理不可微分、受害者输入异步等挑战，使用新型损失函数最大化CP管道的执行时间。

Result: 实验表明，CP-FREEZER将端到端CP延迟增加90倍以上，单帧处理时间超过3秒，攻击成功率达100%。

Conclusion: 揭示了CP系统可用性的严重威胁，亟需开发鲁棒性防御措施。

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可证明安全的RAG系统框架（SAG），通过预存储全加密方案保护检索内容和向量嵌入，确保数据仅对授权实体开放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG系统广泛应用，但其面临的隐私和安全风险（如数据泄露和数据投毒）尚未得到系统解决。现有防御策略存在解释性有限、缺乏形式化安全保证及易受自适应攻击的问题。

Method: 采用预存储全加密方案，对检索内容和向量嵌入进行双重保护，并通过形式化安全证明验证方案的机密性和完整性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架能有效抵抗多种先进攻击。

Conclusion: 本研究为可验证安全的RAG系统奠定了理论和实践基础，推动AI服务向形式化安全保证迈进。

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在对手具有无限计算能力且能监听通信的情况下，战场物联网设备间安全通信的问题。

Method: 使用随机二进制矩阵和预共享的成对密钥，结合有限群模加法实现加密方案。

Result: 方案在语义上是绝对安全的，对手无法获取任何信息；即使矩阵泄露，方案仍对密钥恢复攻击具有计算安全性。

Conclusion: 该加密方案为战场物联网提供了无条件安全且高效的通信保障。

Abstract: We consider an Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system consisting of
multiple devices that want to securely communicate with each other during a
mission in the presence of an adversary with unbounded computational power. The
adversary has complete access to listen/read the ciphertext without tampering
with the communication line. We provide an unconditionally secure encryption
scheme to exchange messages among devices in the system. The main idea behind
the scheme is to provide secret keys to exchange messages using a random binary
matrix that is securely shared among all the devices, and pair-wise random
secret keys established between each pair of devices attempting to communicate
before the mission. The scheme is implemented by using finite group modular
addition. We show that the scheme is absolutely semantically secure, i.e., the
scheme guarantees that an adversary with unbounded computational power cannot
get even one bit of information about a message, except for an exponentially
small probability in a security parameter. Besides that, we show that even if
the random binary matrix is revealed to the adversary, the provided scheme is
computationally secure against the key recovery attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于物联网设备计算能力有限，协作式DNN推理中需动态交换分区信息，导致隐私漏洞。

Method: 利用分类器检测模型信息，结合VAE生成不可追踪的样本，攻击协作推理过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上验证了AdVAR-DNN的高攻击成功率且难以被检测。

Conclusion: AdVAR-DNN有效利用了协作推理的隐私漏洞，为防御此类攻击提供了研究基础。

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly
integral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing.
However, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the
adoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of
the inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often
requires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the
participants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel
privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial
variational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging
classifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable
manipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative
inference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange
vulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in
terms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is
partitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs
on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms
of high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密码学研究集中于算法级可证明安全性，但现实攻击常利用实现层的弱点，缺乏统一的可验证框架。

Method: 提出Implementation-Level Provable Security范式，开发SEER系统，结合密钥擦除、熵验证和执行一致性检查。

Result: SEER实现了强不可恢复性保证，同时保持实用性能。

Conclusion: 展示了从抽象理论模型向实际可验证实现层安全的转变。

Abstract: While traditional cryptographic research focuses on algorithm-level provable
security, many real-world attacks exploit weaknesses in system implementations,
such as memory mismanagement, poor entropy sources, and insecure key
lifecycles. Existing approaches address these risks in isolation but lack a
unified, verifiable framework for modeling implementation-layer security. In
this work, we propose Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm
that defines security in terms of structurally verifiable resilience against
real-world attack surfaces during deployment. To demonstrate its feasibility,
we present SEER (Secure and Efficient Encryption-based Erasure via Ransomware),
a file destruction system that repurposes and reinforces the encryption core of
Babuk ransomware. SEER incorporates key erasure, entropy validation, and
execution consistency checks to ensure a well-constrained, auditable attack
surface. Our evaluation shows that SEER achieves strong irrecoverability
guarantees while maintaining practical performance. This work demonstrates a
shift from abstract theoretical models toward practically verifiable
implementation-layer security.

Motivation: LLM代理的动态和不透明行为带来了安全风险，特别是在提示注入攻击的情况下。

Method: 提出AgentArmor框架，将代理痕迹转换为基于图的中间表示（如CFG、DFG、PDG），并通过类型系统进行静态推理和检查。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，AgentArmor实现了95.75%的TPR和仅3.66%的FPR。

Conclusion: AgentArmor能够有效检测提示注入漏洞并强制执行细粒度安全约束。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

### [45] [Defending Against Beta Poisoning Attacks in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01276)
*Nilufer Gulciftci,M. Emre Gursoy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了四种防御策略（KPB、NCC、CBD、MDT）来对抗Beta Poisoning攻击，实验表明KPB和MDT效果最佳，CBD和NCC也表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beta Poisoning攻击通过破坏训练数据的线性可分性威胁ML模型安全，亟需有效防御方法。

Method: 基于Beta Poisoning样本的特性（如样本聚集性和靠近目标类均值），设计了四种防御策略。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，KPB和MDT实现了完美准确率和F1分数，CBD和NCC也表现强劲。

Conclusion: 四种防御策略有效对抗Beta Poisoning攻击，KPB和MDT尤其突出，为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

Abstract: As an emerging service framework built by combining cryptography, P2P
network, consensus mechanism and innovative contract technology, blockchain has
been widely used in digital finance, data sharing, message traceability and
electronic evidence preservation because of its decentralised, non-tamperable
and transaction traceability. However, with the complex and changeable
application scenarios of blockchain technology and the continuous enhancement
of blockchain attack technology, the security of the blockchain system has been
seriously threatened, dramatically affecting the development and application of
blockchain technology. This paper aims to analyse the attacks on blockchain
from the perspective of cryptography. Firstly, from the cryptography technology
in the blockchain, the principle of hash functions, digital signatures, and
other technologies, as well as their role in the blockchain, are introduced.
Then, based on the six-layer architecture of the blockchain, the attacks on the
data layer, the network layer, the consensus layer, the contract layer, the
incentive layer and the application layer are analysed, and the methods to
mitigate or resist the attacks are proposed. Secondly, the attack principles of
51% attack, Double-Spending attack, Reentrancy attack, Replay attack, Sybil
attack and Timestamp Tampering attack were analysed, and the mitigation or
defence solutions for these six attacks were designed. Finally, the core
problems to be solved in blockchain technology are summarised, and the future
development of blockchain security technology is projected.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自主代理在企业中的广泛应用，多智能体系统面临身份框架碎片化、通信不安全和对恶意代理防御不足等安全风险，传统安全策略无法有效应对。

Method: 提出BlockA2A框架，结合去中心化标识（DIDs）、区块链和智能合约实现跨域身份验证、不可篡改审计和动态访问控制；并设计防御协调引擎（DOE）实时检测和应对攻击。

Result: 实验证明BlockA2A能有效防御基于提示、通信、行为和系统的MAS攻击，且与Google的A2A协议集成时，运行时开销低于1秒。

Conclusion: BlockA2A为LLM驱动的多智能体系统提供了安全、可扩展的解决方案，解决了传统安全策略的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

Motivation: DApps合约层攻击频发，经济损失达660亿美元，漏洞源于未验证外部调用结果。

Method: 结合调用图和图卷积网络，设计边缘预测、节点聚合和Conformer Block模块，增强特征表示和全局结构理解。

Result: 在608个DApps的审计中，UEChecker准确率为87.59%，优于GAT、LSTM和GCN基线模型。

Conclusion: UEChecker能有效检测未检查外部调用漏洞，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Conclusion: MultiCFV为智能合约安全提供了一种高效的多模态检测方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the
blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency
transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart
contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the
loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been
developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or
bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy,
and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep
learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and
detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in
smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control
flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features.
Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments
capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors
are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect
similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic
information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection
and clone detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NATLM的框架，结合静态分析和大型语言模型（LLMs），用于检测NFT智能合约中的潜在缺陷，显著提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NFT的快速发展，其智能合约中的未发现缺陷可能导致重大财务损失，因此需要一种高效的检测方法。

Method: NATLM结合静态分析（提取AST和CFG信息）与LLMs（Gemini Pro 1.5），通过特征向量比较和语义分析增强检测能力。

Result: 实验分析了8,672个NFT智能合约，整体精确率为87.72%，召回率为89.58%，F1得分为88.94%，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: NATLM框架能有效识别四种常见缺陷类型，为NFT智能合约安全提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid
evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets,
they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of
NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to
substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper
presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect
potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies
four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721
Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying
exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a
high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates
static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM
employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow
information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and
Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with
vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the
knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the
analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.
Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection
capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of
potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed
8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,
a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other
baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ConfGuard的轻量级检测方法，通过监控令牌置信度来识别后门攻击中的序列锁定现象，实现了近乎100%的检测率和极低的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对大型语言模型（LLMs）的后门攻击效果不佳，主要因其针对分类任务设计，无法适应LLMs的自回归特性和巨大输出空间。

Method: 通过分析良性模型和后门模型在输出空间的行为差异，发现序列锁定现象，并基于此提出ConfGuard方法，实时监控令牌置信度窗口。

Result: 实验表明，ConfGuard在大多数情况下实现了近乎100%的真阳性率和可忽略的假阳性率，且几乎不增加额外延迟。

Conclusion: ConfGuard是一种高效且实用的后门防御方法，适用于实际LLM部署。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: This study examines how Artificial Intelligence can aid in identifying and
mitigating cyber threats in the U.S. across four key areas: intrusion
detection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat
analysis. Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be
different approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the
problem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we
tested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep
autoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network
traffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like
Random Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic
logs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic
regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.
These models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the
easiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different
story. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user
activity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of
harmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a
threat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw
across the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex
model. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data
behaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But
for messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence
models and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The
takeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.

Motivation: 探讨如何设计安全的权重函数，以确保在诚实方资源权重占优时，区块链能抵御双花攻击。

Method: 通过连续和离散模型分析权重函数的性质，特别是齐次性和对资源的依赖性。

Result: 发现权重函数必须满足齐次性条件（对V和W的度为一），且在离散模型中需对S有温和限制。

Conclusion: 研究为设计新的最长链区块链提供了工具，并建议在实际中采用更优的权重组合方式。

Abstract: The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went
into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a
majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the
highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to
secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of
space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a
VDF).
  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a
weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are
secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by
honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain
is secure against private double-spending attacks.
  We completely classify such functions in an idealized "continuous" model:
{\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only
if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,
{\alpha}{\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\Gamma}(S,{\alpha}V, {\alpha}W). This includes Bitcoin
rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic
model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs
some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not
grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).
  Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the
same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain
blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization,
say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to
use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using
{\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue
that in practice these are much better choices.

Motivation: 现有LLM技术在漏洞检测中表现不佳，无法区分漏洞函数与其良性对应物，且缺乏上下文分析能力，导致误报和错误的CWE关联。

Method: 采用多代理LLM方法，包括三步：(1)代理团队搜索潜在CWE，(2)另一团队提供上下文支持，(3)最终代理基于上下文决策。

Conclusion: 多代理LLM方法通过结合上下文分析，显著提升了漏洞检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection
has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately,
state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even
distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to
three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs
often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques
typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability
detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus
on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but
associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead
developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the
challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a
team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the
function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external
context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes
informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered
context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In
the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\%
of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on
ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information
significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while
still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.

Motivation: 小游戏平台的快速增长导致代码抄袭现象普遍，现有静态分析工具无法有效检测深度混淆技术。

Result: 在包含1,200个小游戏的数据集上，JSidentify-V2成功对抗了八种混淆方法。

Conclusion: 动态分析内存行为模式是检测深度混淆代码抄袭的有效方法。

Abstract: The explosive growth of mini-game platforms has led to widespread code
plagiarism, where malicious users access popular games' source code and
republish them with modifications. While existing static analysis tools can
detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code
injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as
encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely
destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis
ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel
dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing
memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while
obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory
behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage
pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential
memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution
coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to
represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based
similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.
  We evaluate JSidentify-V2 against eight obfuscation methods on a
comprehensive dataset of 1,200 mini-games ...

semi-automatic, and scalable approach for property extraction and testcase (TC)
generation. These TCs are systematically mutated by two domain-specific
transformations. Furthermore, we introduce two deterministic oracles to detect
property violations automatically. Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker
extracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and
detects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret
to 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose
the victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering
the security of cellular networks. We responsibly disclose the findings to all
the related vendors. At the time of writing, one of the vulnerabilities has
been acknowledged by MediaTek with high severity.

*Changze Huang,Di Wang,Zhi Quan Zhou*

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）自动生成网络协议测试序列的新方法，成功发现了12个未知漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议实现中的故障可能导致安全漏洞和系统故障，传统建模方法需要大量领域知识和手动工作，难以扩展。

Method: 利用LLM自动选择协议状态子集并生成状态序列代码，作为协议特定的测试序列生成器。

Result: 在三种广泛使用的网络协议实现中成功识别出12个未知漏洞。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的模糊测试框架在发现实际安全问题方面具有实用效果。

Abstract: Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the
reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in
protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially
in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol
testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state
transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such
models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort,
making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse
protocols and implementations.
  We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations.
Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from
which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this
state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences
of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The
sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol
implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three
widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12
previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective
developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of
our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.

Motivation: 研究高维信任嵌入的重建问题，揭示分布式安全框架中信任分数可能泄露隐私的风险。

Method: 提出了一种直接和估计器，结合四矩特征，并通过Banach理论证明其唯一固定点。实验验证了其在噪声下的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文不仅提出了一种有效的重建方法，还探讨了隐私风险及应对措施，强调了透明性与保密性之间的平衡。

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，软件构建的安全性受到关注，但现有工具无法提供二进制文件等效性的可读证明。

Method: daleq将Java字节码反汇编为关系数据库，并通过datalog规则标准化，生成等效性证明。

Result: 大规模评估显示，daleq显著减少人工检查工作量，并在识别等效性上优于现有工具。

Conclusion: daleq为二进制文件等效性验证提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The security of software builds has attracted increased attention in recent
years in response to incidents like solarwinds and xz. Now, several companies
including Oracle and Google rebuild open source projects in a secure
environment and publish the resulting binaries through dedicated repositories.
This practice enables direct comparison between these rebuilt binaries and the
original ones produced by developers and published in repositories such as
Maven Central. These binaries are often not bitwise identical; however, in most
cases, the differences can be attributed to variations in the build
environment, and the binaries can still be considered equivalent. Establishing
such equivalence, however, is a labor-intensive and error-prone process.
  While there are some tools that can be used for this purpose, they all fall
short of providing provenance, i.e. readable explanation of why two binaries
are equivalent, or not. To address this issue, we present daleq, a tool that
disassembles Java byte code into a relational database, and can normalise this
database by applying datalog rules. Those databases can then be used to infer
equivalence between two classes. Notably, equivalence statements are
accompanied with datalog proofs recording the normalisation process. We
demonstrate the impact of daleq in an industrial context through a large-scale
evaluation involving 2,714 pairs of jars, comprising 265,690 class pairs. In
this evaluation, daleq is compared to two existing bytecode transformation
tools. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the manual effort
required to assess non-bitwise equivalent artifacts, which would otherwise
demand intensive human inspection. Furthermore, the results show that daleq
outperforms existing tools by identifying more artifacts rebuilt from the same
code as equivalent, even when no behavioral differences are present.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies,
has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于方向映射模块和对抗知识蒸馏（BeDKD）的新型后门防御方法，有效平衡防御效果与模型性能，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法依赖大量干净数据且难以完全消除触发器效应，导致攻击成功率居高不下。

Method: 通过方向映射模块识别中毒数据，并结合对抗知识蒸馏机制，循环迭代强化干净映射并抑制后门映射。

Result: 实验表明，BeDKD在三种数据集上优于现有防御方法，攻击成功率降低98%，且不影响分类准确率。

Conclusion: BeDKD为后门防御提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了防御效果。

Abstract: Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating
backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most
of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but
generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently
high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
Backdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial
Knowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense
effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned
data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned
data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small
set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is
designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a
cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean
and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream
attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD
surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without
significantly reducing the CACC. Our code are available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法依赖不自然的对抗提示、缺乏通用性且易被防御机制检测。本文旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 提出了一种只需少量隐蔽后门样本即可生成任意目标图像的框架，适用于多种T2I DMs，并对抗现有防御机制。

Result: 实验表明，仅需10个精心设计的后门样本，攻击成功率超过90%，且不影响良性图像生成质量。

Conclusion: 该攻击框架有效且难以防御，凸显了对更鲁棒防御机制的迫切需求。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generating high-quality and diverse images from text prompts, yet recent
studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Existing attack
methods suffer from critical limitations: 1) they rely on unnatural adversarial
prompts that lack human readability and require massive poisoned data; 2) their
effectiveness is typically restricted to specific models, lacking
generalizability; and 3) they can be mitigated by recent backdoor defenses.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework
that achieves three key properties: 1) \emph{Practicality}: Our attack requires
only a few stealthy backdoor samples to generate arbitrary attacker-chosen
target images, as well as ensuring high-quality image generation in benign
scenarios. 2) \emph{Generalizability:} The attack is applicable across multiple
T2I DMs without requiring model-specific redesign. 3) \emph{Robustness:} The
attack remains effective against existing backdoor defenses and adaptive
defenses. Our extensive experimental results on multiple T2I DMs demonstrate
that with only 10 carefully crafted backdoored samples, our attack method
achieves $>$90\% attack success rate with negligible degradation in benign
image generation quality. We also conduct human evaluation to validate our
attack effectiveness. Furthermore, recent backdoor detection and mitigation
methods, as well as adaptive defense tailored to our attack are not
sufficiently effective, highlighting the pressing need for more robust defense
mechanisms against the proposed attack.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在加密敏感信息时忽略用户输入逻辑结构的问题，导致数据效用降低和CLLM性能下降。

Method: SE框架包含语义编码和解码两个阶段，通过本地轻量模型转换用户输入以隐藏敏感信息，同时保留语义结构和意图。

Result: 实验表明SE在保护隐私的同时不损害数据效用或用户体验，性能优于现有方法InferDPT。

Conclusion: SE为CLLM的安全交互提供了实用解决方案，显著提升了隐私保护和性能。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

Motivation: 当前防御策略对隐蔽且鲁棒的后门攻击效果有限，检测方法依赖粗粒度特征统计，净化方法需完全重训练或额外干净模型。

Method: DUP通过联合利用类无关距离和层间过渡捕获特征级异常，检测后通过知识蒸馏引导学生模型遗忘后门行为。

Result: 实验表明，DUP在检测准确性和净化效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUP为后门攻击防御提供了高效且无需外部干净模型的解决方案。

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

Abstract: The steady advancement in quantum computer error correction technology has
pushed the current record to 48 stable logical qubits, bringing us closer to
machines capable of running Shor's algorithm at scales that threaten RSA and
ECC cryptography. While the timeline for developing such quantum computers
remains uncertain, the cryptographic community must prepare for the transition
to quantum-resistant algorithms. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by NIST in 2022,
represents a leading post-quantum cryptographic solution, but widespread
adoption faces significant challenges. If this migration follows patterns
similar to the SHA-1 to SHA-2 transition, organizations may experience
prolonged periods of vulnerability, with substantial security and economic
consequences. This study evaluates Kyber's practical viability through
performance testing across various implementation schemes, utilizing only
standard built-in processor acceleration features, some of which include AES-NI
and ASIMD, without any specialized hardware additions. Our findings demonstrate
that Kyber provides robust security guarantees against quantum attacks while
maintaining acceptable performance profiles for most contemporary applications,
utilizing only commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration
capabilities.

Abstract: Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for
obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However,
their practical deployments face significant challenges, including
susceptibility to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered metadata analysis,
difficulties in decentralized architectures, and the absence of provable
security guarantees. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
decentralized anonymous routing protocol with resistance to tracing and traffic
analysis. The protocol eliminates dependencies on the threshold model and
trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy even in
highly adversarial environments. Different from traditional empirical security
analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable
identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments.
Furthermore, simulations confirm its practical feasibility, demonstrating both
security and efficiency. By achieving information sharing with privacy
preservation, the proposed protocol offers a provably secure solution for
privacy-preserving communication in digital environments.

Conclusion: GPU侧信道泄漏对部署的Transformer模型构成严重安全威胁，需引起重视。

Abstract: Transformers have become the backbone of many Machine Learning (ML)
applications, including language translation, summarization, and computer
vision. As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns
around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks
that reveal architectural details without physical access remains
underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target.
This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power
and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract
information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows
how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical
architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both
language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by
evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are
publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate
that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model
family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both
single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by
leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly
effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate
exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel
leakage in deployed transformer models.

Conclusion: RouteMark为MoE合并模型中的知识产权验证提供了实用且广泛适用的框架。

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining
content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to

Conclusion: 文章总结了漏洞类型并提出了防御建议，强调了漏洞修复和防护措施的重要性。

Abstract: Mirai is undoubtedly one of the most significant Internet of Things (IoT)
botnet attacks in history. In terms of its detrimental effects, seamless
spread, and low detection rate, it surpassed its predecessors. Its developers
released the source code, which triggered the development of several variants
that combined the old code with newer vulnerabilities found on popular IoT
devices. The prominent variants, Satori, Mukashi, Moobot, and Sonic1, together
target more than 15 unique known vulnerabilities discovered between 2014-2021.
The vulnerabilities include but are not limited to improper input validation,
command injections, insufficient credential protection, and out-of-bound
writes. With these new attack strategies, Satori compromised more than a
quarter million devices within the first twelve hours of its release and peaked
at almost 700,000 infected devices. Similarly, Mukashi made more than a hundred
million Zyxel NAS devices vulnerable through its new exploits. This article
reviews the attack methodologies and impacts of these variants in detail. It
summarizes the common vulnerabilities targeted by these variants and analyzes
the infection mechanism through vulnerability analysis. This article also
provides an overview of possible defense solutions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于区块链和自主权身份（SSI）的去中心化框架，以解决学术出版中的伦理问题，如作者身份模糊、未披露的利益冲突等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版面临伦理问题，现有基础设施无法有效解决作者身份验证、贡献确认和利益冲突检测。

Method: 利用去中心化标识符（DIDs）和可验证凭证（VCs）验证作者身份与贡献，区块链记录不可篡改的作者同意和审稿活动，零知识证明（ZKPs）保护隐私。

Result: 框架提高了伦理合规性和学术交流的信任度，调查显示其受到研究者、编辑和审稿人的认可。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更透明、可靠和可信的学术出版生态系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) face unprecedented security
challenges due to their inherent characteristics, such as multidimensional
heterogeneity and dynamic topologies. These characteristics fundamentally
undermine conventional security methods and traditional artificial intelligence
(AI)-driven solutions. Generative AI (GAI) is a transformative approach that
can safeguard SAGIN security by synthesizing data, understanding semantics, and
making autonomous decisions. This survey fills existing review gaps by
examining GAI-empowered secure communications across SAGINs. First, we
introduce secured SAGINs and highlight GAI's advantages over traditional AI for
security defenses. Then, we explain how GAI mitigates failures of authenticity,
breaches of confidentiality, tampering of integrity, and disruptions of
availability across the physical, data link, and network layers of SAGINs.
Three step-by-step tutorials discuss how to apply GAI to solve specific
problems using concrete methods, emphasizing its generative paradigm beyond
traditional AI. Finally, we outline open issues and future research directions,
including lightweight deployment, adversarial robustness, and cross-domain
governance, to provide major insights into GAI's role in shaping
next-generation SAGIN security.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GPU在智能交通系统中的安全问题，尤其是未经授权的加密挖矿对AI工作负载的影响，并提出了一种基于设备遥测的检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU在智能交通系统中广泛应用，但其安全性常被忽视，容易受到攻击，如未经授权的加密挖矿，影响关键AI任务。

Method: 通过案例研究，使用YOLOv8视频处理管道和RTX 2060 GPU，模拟加密挖矿对性能的影响，并利用GPU遥测数据训练轻量级分类器进行检测。

Result: 加密挖矿导致帧率下降50%，功耗增加90%，检测模型表现出高准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁关注GPU在智能交通系统中的可观测性漏洞，并提供了可复用的检测框架。

Abstract: Graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming an essential part of the
intelligent transportation system (ITS) for enabling video-based and artificial
intelligence (AI) based applications. GPUs provide high-throughput and
energy-efficient computing for tasks like sensor fusion and roadside video
analytics. However, these GPUs are one of the most unmonitored components in
terms of security. This makes them vulnerable to cyber and hardware attacks,
including unauthorized crypto mining. This paper highlights GPU security as a
critical blind spot in transportation cybersecurity. To support this concern,
it also presents a case study showing the impact of stealthy unauthorized
crypto miners on critical AI workloads, along with a detection strategy. We
used a YOLOv8-based video processing pipeline running on an RTX 2060 GPU for
the case study. A multi-streaming application was executed while a T-Rex crypto
miner ran in the background. We monitored how the miner degraded GPU
performance by reducing the frame rate and increasing power consumption, which
could be a serious concern for GPUs operating in autonomous vehicles or
battery-powered edge devices. We observed measurable impacts using GPU
telemetry (nvidia-smi) and Nsight Compute profiling, where frame rate dropped
by 50 percent, and power usage increased by up to 90%. To detect, we trained
lightweight classifiers using extracted telemetry features. All models achieved
high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This paper raises urgent
awareness about GPU observability gaps in ITS and offers a replicable framework
for detecting GPU misuse through on-device telemetry.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal
identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the
unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks
necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems,
enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the
Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance
model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims
to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential
controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Android应用权限的使用情况，揭示了良性应用和恶意应用在权限请求上的不同策略，并通过关联规则挖掘发现权限组合模式，强调了持续监控和用户教育的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android应用权限的滥用问题普遍存在，尽管有官方文档指导，但缺乏对权限使用趋势和模式的全面分析。

Method: 研究通过分析Google Play Store中的应用权限请求，区分良性应用和恶意应用，并利用FP-Growth算法进行关联规则挖掘。

Result: 发现恶意应用倾向于请求较少权限以逃避检测，而良性应用请求更多权限以增强功能；同时揭示了权限组合的显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了持续监控、用户教育和监管的必要性，以有效应对权限滥用问题。

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PhishParrot是一种新型爬虫环境优化系统，利用大型语言模型（LLM）的上下文分析能力，通过构建最优用户配置文件来对抗钓鱼网站的伪装技术，显著提高了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击的伪装技术使传统检测系统失效，需要一种新方法来识别和应对这些动态攻击。

Method: PhishParrot通过LLM分析上下文信息，构建用户配置文件，并调整浏览器和网络配置以匹配攻击者的目标用户条件。

Result: 在21天的评估中，PhishParrot的检测准确率提高了33.8%，生成了91种不同的爬虫环境。

Conclusion: 结合相似案例提取和LLM上下文分析的方法，能有效检测伪装钓鱼攻击。

Abstract: Phishing attacks continue to evolve, with cloaking techniques posing a
significant challenge to detection efforts. Cloaking allows attackers to
display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages
to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This
research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system
designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual
analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential
patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user
profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates
information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then
adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's
target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A
21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to
33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling
environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm
that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis
is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.

TL;DR: FPEdit是一种新型的知识编辑框架，通过修改稀疏的模型权重子集注入语义连贯的自然语言指纹，实现隐秘且精确的所有权编码，同时保持模型核心功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为重要的知识产权资产，容易受到未经授权的重新分发和商业利用。现有指纹方法在参数访问和隐蔽性之间存在权衡。

Method: FPEdit通过修改稀疏权重子集注入自然语言指纹，确保隐蔽性和精确性。

Result: 实验显示FPEdit在多种条件下（如微调、量化、剪枝）保持95%-100%的指纹保留率，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: FPEdit首次同时实现了对适应性、检测抵抗力和模型效用的保护，为对抗性部署场景下的模型来源验证提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Coward的新防御方法，通过多后门碰撞效应检测联邦学习中的后门攻击，解决了现有被动和主动防御的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门检测技术（被动和主动防御）在非独立同分布数据和随机参与情况下存在局限性，主动防御还存在分布外偏差问题。

Method: 利用多后门碰撞效应，通过评估服务器注入的冲突全局水印是否被擦除来检测攻击者。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验证实了Coward的有效性及其对潜在自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Coward在保持主动防御优势的同时，通过改进的检测机制减轻了分布外偏差的负面影响。

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SUAD Attack的长距离、跨障碍、无干扰的无声语音攻击方法，并通过SUAD Defense防御机制有效阻断此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音助手（VAs）的普及，其安全性问题日益突出。现有无声攻击受限于成本、距离或视线，因此需要一种更高效的攻击与防御方案。

Method: 1. 分析固体通道中的信号传播特性；2. 设计模块化命令生成模型，适应不同固体通道状态；3. 提出SUAD Defense，利用超声扰动信号阻断无声攻击。

Result: 实验表明，SUAD Attack激活成功率达89.8%以上，SUAD Defense阻断成功率达98%以上。

Conclusion: SUAD Attack和SUAD Defense为无声语音攻击与防御提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As a versatile AI application, voice assistants (VAs) have become
increasingly popular, but are vulnerable to security threats. Attackers have
proposed various inaudible attacks, but are limited by cost, distance, or LoS.
Therefore, we propose \name~Attack, a long-range, cross-barrier, and
interference-free inaudible voice attack via solid channels. We begin by
thoroughly analyzing the dispersion effect in solid channels, revealing its
unique impact on signal propagation. To avoid distortions in voice commands, we
design a modular command generation model that parameterizes attack distance,
victim audio, and medium dispersion features to adapt to variations in the
solid-channel state. Additionally, we propose SUAD Defense, a universal defense
that uses ultrasonic perturbation signals to block inaudible voice attacks
(IVAs) without impacting normal speech. Since the attack can occur at arbitrary
frequencies and times, we propose a training method that randomizes both time
and frequency to generate perturbation signals that break ultrasonic commands.
Notably, the perturbation signal is modulated to an inaudible frequency without
affecting the functionality of voice commands for VAs. Experiments on six
smartphones have shown that SUAD Attack achieves activation success rates above
89.8% and SUAD Defense blocks IVAs with success rates exceeding 98%.

Motivation: 智能合约升级虽然灵活，但破坏了合约的不可变性，带来安全隐患。现有研究对升级行为的安全影响分析有限。

Method: 构建包含83,085个升级合约和20,902条升级链的数据集，基于37个真实安全事件分类升级风险，并调查公众认知。

Result: 发现八种升级风险，其中四种被公众忽视且缺乏缓解措施；初步检测到31,407个相关问题。

Conclusion: 智能合约升级存在严重安全隐患，需加强公众认知和缓解措施。

Abstract: Smart contract upgrades are increasingly common due to their flexibility in
modifying deployed contracts, such as fixing bugs or adding new
functionalities. Meanwhile, upgrades compromise the immutability of contracts,
introducing significant security concerns. While existing research has explored
the security impacts of contract upgrades, these studies are limited in
collection of upgrade behaviors and identification of insecurities.
  To address these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study on the
insecurities of upgrade behaviors. First, we build a dataset containing 83,085
upgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. To our knowledge, this is the
first large-scale dataset about upgrade behaviors, revealing their diversity
and exposing gaps in public disclosure. Next, we develop a taxonomy of
insecurities based on 37 real-world security incidents, categorizing eight
types of upgrade risks and providing the first complete view of upgrade-related
insecurities. Finally, we survey public awareness of these risks and existing
mitigations. Our findings show that four types of security risks are overlooked
by the public and lack mitigation measures. We detect these upgrade risks
through a preliminary study, identifying 31,407 related issues - a finding that
raises significant concerns.

Method: 提出Covert Event Channel模型，设计ΠCCAP协议，利用事件驱动的代理对话实现隐蔽通信。

Result: ΠCCAP协议在容量、鲁棒性和隐蔽性方面表现优异，能抵抗基于LLM的监控。

Conclusion: 该研究为安全可信的IoA提供了基础，推动了下一代监控系统和防御协议的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges
for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to
protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to
surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature
of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert
communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert
Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by
three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and
Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a
novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and
robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens,
establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this
channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for
developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols
for a secure and trustworthy IoA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward
data security in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT网络和设备设计时优先考虑功能而非安全，导致固有漏洞，暴露在互联网上增加了风险。

Method: 通过分析暴露的OT设备、协议、软件和地理位置，结合自动化截图分析揭示潜在威胁。

Result: 发现大量设备使用过时固件，存在已知漏洞，且未修补多年；同时揭示了HMI和SCADA系统的潜在访问路径。

Conclusion: 暴露的OT设备对关键基础设施构成重大风险，需加强安全措施。

Abstract: Operational Technology (OT) is an integral component of critical national
infrastructure, enabling automation and control in industries such as energy,
manufacturing, and transportation. However, OT networks, systems, and devices
have been designed and deployed prioritising functionality rather than
security. This leads to inherent vulnerabilities in many deployed systems when
operational misconfigurations expose them to the internet. This report provides
an up-to-date overview of the OT threat landscape exposed to the public
internet and studies the affected protocols, vendors, software, and the
geographic distribution of systems. Our findings reveal nearly 70,000 exposed
OT devices globally, with significant concentrations in North America and
Europe. Analysis of prevalent protocols (e.g., ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7)
shows that many devices expose detailed identifying information, including
outdated firmware versions with known critical vulnerabilities that remain
unpatched for years after disclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate how automated
analysis of screenshots can uncover exposed graphical interfaces of Human
Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
systems, highlighting diverse pathways for potential unauthorized access and
underscoring the risks to industrial processes and critical infrastructure.

Abstract: Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) offers a secure and lightweight
alternative to traditional cryptography for authentication due to their unique
device fingerprint. However, their dependence on specialized hardware hinders
their adoption in diverse applications. This paper proposes a novel blockchain
framework that leverages SoftPUF, a software-based approach mimicking PUF.
SoftPUF addresses the hardware limitations of traditional PUF, enabling secure
and efficient authentication for a broader range of devices within a blockchain
network. The framework utilizes a machine learning model trained on PUF data to
generate unique, software-based keys for each device. These keys serve as
secure identifiers for authentication on the blockchain, eliminating the need
for dedicated hardware. This approach facilitates the integration of legacy
devices from various domains, including cloud-based solutions, into the
blockchain network. Additionally, the framework incorporates well-established
defense mechanisms to ensure robust security against various attacks. This
combined approach paves the way for secure and scalable authentication in
diverse blockchain-based applications. Additionally, to ensure robust security,
the system incorporates well-established defense mechanisms against various
attacks, including 51%, phishing, routing, and Sybil attacks, into the
blockchain network. This combined approach paves the way for secure and
efficient authentication in a wider range of blockchain-based applications.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了Android跟踪软件的行为与能力演变，探讨了平台隐私改进对其功能的影响，并提出了新的防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪软件对个人隐私构成严重威胁，现有研究多集中于检测与移除，但缺乏更有效的防御方法。

Method: 结合多种分析技术，对大量Android跟踪软件进行系统分析，量化其行为与能力演变。

Result: 揭示了跟踪软件的新战术，并探讨了Android平台隐私改进对其功能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为开发替代防御策略提供了新见解。

Abstract: Stalkerware is a serious threat to individuals' privacy that is receiving
increased attention from the security and privacy research communities.
Existing works have largely focused on studying leading stalkerware apps,
dual-purpose apps, monetization of stalkerware, or the experience of survivors.
However, there remains a need to understand potential defenses beyond the
detection-and-removal approach, which may not necessarily be effective in the
context of stalkerware.
  In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis of a large corpus of recent
Android stalkerware apps. We combine multiple analysis techniques to quantify
stalkerware behaviors and capabilities and how these evolved over time. Our
primary goal is understanding: how (and whether) recent Android platform
changes -- largely designed to improve user privacy -- have thwarted
stalkerware functionality; how stalkerware may have adapted as a result; and
what we may conclude about potential defenses. Our investigation reveals new
insights into tactics used by stalkerware and may inspire alternative defense
strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种后量子安全的同态加密方案（BFV、BGV、CKKS）在车辆通信场景中的实际性能，验证了其在智能交通系统中保护隐私的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统依赖车辆数据，但隐私保护是关键挑战，同态加密提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 研究对BFV、BGV和CKKS三种方案进行了实验评估，考虑了加密车辆计数和平均速度聚合两种隐私保护用例。

Result: BFV和BGV适用于延迟容忍的应用，CKKS适用于周期性数值数据聚合。实验表明同态加密在128位后量子安全下可行。

Conclusion: 同态加密可作为智能交通系统中安全隐私保护的基础工具，但需考虑方案特定的延迟约束。

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) fundamentally rely on
vehicle-generated data for applications such as congestion monitoring and route
optimization, making the preservation of user privacy a critical challenge.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising solution by enabling computation
on encrypted data without revealing underlying content. This study presents the
first real-world experimental evaluation of three post-quantum secure HE
schemes, i.e., Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan
(BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), for vehicular communication scenarios.
Two representative privacy-preserving use cases are considered: encrypted
vehicle counting and average speed aggregation. Experiments are conducted over
both Wi-Fi and Ethernet to assess performance under wireless and wired
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) settings. Results show that BFV and BGV are
suitable for latency-tolerant applications such as intersection monitoring and
regional traffic analysis, with total end-to-end latencies under 10 seconds.
While CKKS experiences higher overhead, it remains viable for periodic
encrypted aggregation of numerical data. The experimental results demonstrate
that HE can be feasibly deployed in ITS environments under 128-bit post-quantum
security, provided that scheme-specific latency constraints are considered.
This reinforces its potential to serve as a foundational tool for secure and
privacy-preserving V2X data processing.

TL;DR: PoseGuard是一个安全对齐框架，用于抑制基于姿势引导的视频生成中的不安全内容，同时保持良性输入的高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于姿势引导的视频生成中可能导致的冒充、隐私侵犯和NSFW内容等风险。

Method: 采用双目标训练策略，结合生成保真度和安全对齐，并使用LoRA微调进行轻量级参数更新。

Result: 实验证明PoseGuard能有效阻止不安全生成，保持良性输入的质量，并对轻微姿势变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PoseGuard为姿势引导生成提供了一种灵活且模块化的安全解决方案，并能扩展到其他引导生成任务。

Abstract: Pose-guided video generation has become a powerful tool in creative
industries, exemplified by frameworks like Animate Anyone. However,
conditioning generation on specific poses introduces serious risks, such as
impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation. To address these
challenges, we propose $\textbf{PoseGuard}$, a safety alignment framework for
pose-guided generation. PoseGuard is designed to suppress unsafe generations by
degrading output quality when encountering malicious poses, while maintaining
high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs. We categorize unsafe poses into three
representative types: discriminatory gestures such as kneeling or offensive
salutes, sexually suggestive poses that lead to NSFW content, and poses
imitating copyrighted celebrity movements. PoseGuard employs a dual-objective
training strategy combining generation fidelity with safety alignment, and uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning for efficient, parameter-light updates. To ensure
adaptability to evolving threats, PoseGuard supports pose-specific LoRA fusion,
enabling flexible and modular updates when new unsafe poses are identified. We
further demonstrate the generalizability of PoseGuard to facial landmark-guided
generation. Extensive experiments validate that PoseGuard effectively blocks
unsafe generations, maintains generation quality for benign inputs, and remains
robust against slight pose variations.

Result: 构建了一个交通专用网络事件数据库，并开发了问答系统，提高了数据的可访问性和实用性。

Conclusion: 通过LLM在数据提取和用户交互中的应用，本文为提升交通行业网络安全意识提供了新颖且实用的工具。

Abstract: Technological advancements have revolutionized numerous industries, including
transportation. While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have
enhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities.
With 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity
awareness in transportation is increasingly critical. Despite numerous
cyberattacks on transportation systems worldwide, comprehensive and centralized
records of these incidents remain scarce. To address this gap and enhance cyber
awareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to
extract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly
available datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI
to transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured
formats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International
Studies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland
Cyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents
(EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT
Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks
in Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM
into five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal,
forming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key
contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented
Generation question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and
practical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific
details on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both
data extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel,
accessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决群签名中完全匿名可能导致的滥用问题，NGS通过引入灵活公钥实现可审计性。

Method: 将灵活公钥集成到群签名框架中，提出安全模型并在随机预言模型中证明其安全性。

Result: 构建了NGS方案，并开发了基于以太坊的NickHat原型系统。

Conclusion: NGS在保持匿名性的同时支持审计，适用于区块链等场景。

Abstract: Nicknames for Group Signatures (NGS) is a new signature scheme that extends
Group Signatures (GS) with Signatures with Flexible Public Keys (SFPK). Via GS,
each member of a group can sign messages on behalf of the group without
revealing his identity, except to a designated auditor. Via SFPK, anyone can
create new identities for a particular user, enabling anonymous transfers with
only the intended recipient able to trace these new identities.
  To prevent the potential abuses that this anonymity brings, NGS integrates
flexible public keys into the GS framework to support auditable transfers. In
addition to introducing NGS, we describe its security model and provide a
mathematical construction proved secure in the Random Oracle Model. As a
practical NGS use case, we build NickHat, a blockchain-based token-exchange
prototype system on top of Ethereum.

*Shafizur Rahman Seeam,Ye Zheng,Zhengxiong Li,Yidan Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivAR是一个客户端隐私框架，用于实时基于位置的增强现实（LB-AR）应用，通过两种轻量级机制提供强隐私保护和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LB-AR应用（如Pokémon Go）需要高频GPS更新，但现有方法无法同时满足实时隐私保护和高质量服务（QoS）的需求。

Method: PrivAR引入两种机制：Planar Staircase Mechanism（PSM）生成噪声位置以保护单点隐私，Thresholded Reporting with PSM（TR-PSM）选择性发布更新以增强轨迹隐私。

Result: 实验显示，PrivAR将QoS（Gamescore）提升50%，攻击者误差增加1.8倍，运行时开销仅增加0.06毫秒。

Conclusion: PrivAR成功填补了LB-AR中实时隐私保护的空白，同时保持低延迟和高服务质量。

Abstract: Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pok\'emon Go,
stream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user
experiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious
privacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging
than in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time
location protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy
guaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS).
Existing methods fail to meet these combined demands.
  To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework
for real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar
Staircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to
generate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected
error; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme
that releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a
private threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level
privacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive
experiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and
validate PrivAR on a Pok\'emon-Go-style prototype. Results show PrivAR improves
QoS (Gamescore) by up to 50%, while increasing attacker error by 1.8x over
baseline with an additional 0.06 milliseconds runtime overhead.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

Motivation: 解决‘状态’概念缺乏共识和形式化定义的问题，为智能定义、形式逻辑和科学理论提供数学基础。

Result: 建立了一个基于‘定义=状态’原则的元形式逻辑框架，适用于智能定义和跨域理论。

Conclusion: 论文为智能定义和跨域理论提供了数学上严谨的统一框架。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种在多阶段复杂任务中优化测试时计算资源分配的方法AgentTTS，通过LLM代理框架实现高效搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展（TTS）研究主要针对单阶段任务，而现实问题多为多阶段复杂任务，需要针对不同子任务分配特定模型和计算资源。

Method: 通过广泛实验总结三个经验性洞察，提出AgentTTS框架，利用LLM代理通过迭代反馈自主搜索最优资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，AgentTTS在搜索效率和鲁棒性上显著优于传统方法和其他基于LLM的基线。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为多阶段复杂任务中的计算资源优化提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI的发展，伦理风险增加，需要一种灵活、透明且鲁棒的伦理风险评估框架。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法和确定性因子，通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化风险。

Result: 案例研究验证了ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感的伦理风险评分，结果可靠且可解释。

Conclusion: ff4ERA能提供可解释、可追踪的风险评估，支持伦理决策。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

Motivation: 验证大型语言模型在风险决策中是否表现出与人类相似的非理性行为，尤其是前景理论中的'框架效应'。

Method: 通过不同情境（如军事与民用）测试大型语言模型的风险决策行为，分析其是否受'框架效应'影响。

Result: 模型在风险决策中表现出与人类相似的行为，情境（如军事场景）显著影响风险偏好。

Conclusion: 语言模型捕捉了人类的启发式和偏见，但这些偏见具有情境依赖性，支持维特根斯坦的'语言游戏'理论。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

Result: 在四个数据集上，CHECK比五种最先进框架平均提升了22.8%的MQA准确率。

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化显著提升了LLMs在组合推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for

automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec为研究者和实践者提供了高效、可扩展的大规模知识图谱嵌入生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

TL;DR: 生成式AI（如ChatGPT）的输出可能重复且带有偏见，更严重的是其可能在回答过程中突然从正确转为误导或错误，导致巨大损失。研究通过数学映射揭示了一个隐藏的“翻转点”，并提出了量化用户风险和法律责任的方法。


<details>

Motivation: 生成式AI的输出不稳定性和潜在风险（如经济损失和人身伤害）促使研究其内在机制，以提高透明度和可解释性。

Method: 通过数学映射将AI的Attention head与多自旋热系统关联，推导出翻转点的精确公式，并分析多层架构对输出翻转的放大效应。

Result: 揭示了AI输出翻转的隐藏机制，提出了量化用户风险和法律责任的方法，有助于提升AI的透明度和性能。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为改进AI的透明度和性能提供了理论基础，还为量化用户风险和法律责任开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Motivation: 探索社会经济指标（如家庭财富）是否可通过卫星图像和互联网文本捕捉，以提供更全面的财富预测方法。

Method: 使用多模态框架，结合卫星图像、LLM生成文本和AI代理检索的文本，通过五种管道预测家庭财富。

Result: 融合视觉与文本数据的模型表现最佳（R-squared 0.77），LLM知识比代理检索文本更有效，部分表征收敛。

Conclusion: 多模态方法优于单一模态，LLM知识更稳健，代理数据在某些情况下提供补充信息，发布大规模数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在轨迹预测中存在灾难性遗忘问题，限制了其在动态分布场景中的实际应用。

Method: H2C通过两种互补策略选择代表性样本，并通过记忆回放损失函数更新模型，以保留知识。

Result: 实验表明，H2C在INTERACTION数据集上平均减少了22.71%的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: H2C为动态场景下的轨迹预测提供了一种有效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态情感推理中忽视情感冲突场景，导致模型过度依赖音频信号，忽略视觉模态。

Method: 提出MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE（模态特定专家）和AR（注意力重分配机制），平衡模态贡献。

Result: MoSEAR在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在模态冲突条件下。

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效缓解情感冲突，提升模型性能，无需在音频和视觉模态间权衡。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

Motivation: CoT提示看似能产生类人推理步骤，但初步研究表明其可能较为表面化，研究者希望进一步探索其本质。

Method: 通过数据分布视角研究CoT推理，设计DataAlchemy环境，从零训练LLM并系统测试不同分布条件下的表现。

Result: CoT推理在超出训练分布时表现脆弱，其有效性受限于训练与测试数据的分布差异。

Conclusion: CoT推理并非真正的泛化推理，其失败原因与数据分布密切相关，突显了实现真正泛化推理的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试面临高成本构建和数据集污染风险的问题，需要一种更高效的评估方法。

Method: 基于重要性采样理论和重要性加权自编码器，BIS通过重新加权现有标注基准的样本来预测新基准的表现，并引入权重截断策略以稳定估计。

Conclusion: BIS是一种高效且可靠的评估工具，可显著降低代码相关任务中基准测试的成本和努力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Motivation: 现有诊断模型在复杂场景（如分布偏移）中缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法为故障检测提供了理论框架，实现了明确的风险控制，提升了诊断系统的可信度。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Result: 提出了包含8类图表的Sketch2Diagram Benchmark数据集，包含6000多个高质量示例，显著减少人工需求。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计、教育和工程中有广泛应用前景，填补了草图与机器可读图表间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展定义了资源受限语言模型的效率前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中具有高效性和可部署性，但成员推理攻击（MIAs）对其隐私和知识产权构成威胁。尽管MIAs在大型语言模型（LLMs）中有效，但在SLMs中研究较少且效果较差。

Method: 提出了一种基于min-k的新攻击方法win-k，并在三个数据集和八个SLMs上进行了实验评估。

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有MIAs，尤其是在更小的模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种有效的针对SLMs的成员推理攻击方法，尤其在小型模型中表现突出。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，知识冲突问题日益突出，尤其是在多上下文冲突（inter-context knowledge conflicts）中，LLMs容易因冗长且矛盾的上下文而混淆。

Method: KCR框架通过提取文本或局部知识图的推理路径，利用强化学习训练模型选择逻辑一致的上下文，从而建立正确的推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长文本场景中解决知识冲突的能力，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: KCR框架为LLMs解决知识冲突提供了一种有效的方法，强化了模型在复杂上下文中的推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

TL;DR: Multi-TW是首个用于评估多模态模型性能和延迟的传统中文基准，包含900道选择题，覆盖图像、文本和音频模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在传统中文的三模态评估和推理延迟方面存在不足，Multi-TW填补了这一空白。

Method: Multi-TW基于官方汉语水平测试题目，评估了多种多模态模型和视觉语言模型（带音频转录）。

Result: 闭源模型在多模态任务中表现更优，但开源模型在音频任务中表现良好；端到端多模态管道在延迟上优于视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: Multi-TW展示了模型能力的全面视图，并强调了传统中文微调和高效多模态架构的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学研究中识别新假设至关重要，但现有自动化方法难以生成新颖且证据支持的假设，且缺乏迭代优化和严格的时间评估。

Method: BioDisco采用多智能体框架，结合语言模型推理和双模式证据系统（生物医学知识图谱和文献检索），并集成内部评分和反馈循环进行迭代优化。

Result: 评估显示BioDisco在新颖性和重要性上优于现有架构，并通过时间和人类评估验证其性能。

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个灵活且模块化的工具，可促进新假设的发现。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在AI规划中的可靠性，解决其生成的计划常含错误或虚构动作的问题。

Method: 提出一个包含NLP评估和三阶段恢复的流程，结合符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 发现LLM生成的计划平均仅前2.65个动作可执行，恢复流程将成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%。

Conclusion: LLM在规划任务中缺乏可靠推理能力，NLP恢复流程虽能提升质量，但仍不及传统规划器。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为关键问题，现有方法依赖提示工程或语义转换，但效果有限。

Method: 设计了三种字谜类型（单词搜索、变位词、填字游戏），要求LLM解谜后重构有害指令并生成响应。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率达88.8%，其中GPT-4.1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet分别达到96.5%和92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单而强大的方式，利用LLM的推理能力，将字谜转化为有效的越狱策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统快速发展下人类与机器工作分配的动态平衡及其对社会的影响。

Method: 使用格论固定点工具（Tarski和Banach）证明均衡存在性和唯一性，并通过连续模型和模拟分析自动化份额。

Result: 证明存在稳定均衡，自动化份额为x*=α/(α+β)，模拟预测2045年自动化占65%。

Conclusion: 人类将转向“工作流指挥”角色，政策应促进人机协作以实现福利最大化。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Conclusion: DCUE为未来设计更实用可靠的遗忘算法提供了有效指导。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics

identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Motivation: 现有评估基准在准确性、可重复性和可扩展性上的不足严重阻碍了LLM驱动的GUI代理的发展。

Method: 设计了基于因果路径的Benchmark，将复杂任务分解为可验证的原子步骤；开发了分层代理Agent，并通过强化微调（RFT）优化模型。

Conclusion: 研究为GUI代理的未来发展提供了严格的评估标准和高质量数据集，揭示了小模型在综合任务中的能力上限。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end
assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法基于固定POI集的封闭世界假设，无法捕捉探索性行为或城市道路网络的拓扑约束，因此需要更灵活的预测框架。

Method: 采用道路节点为中心的框架，结合方向性POI聚合和结构图嵌入，使用Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer进行序列建模。

Result: 在城市规模轨迹数据上，模型在准确率和MRR上显著优于基线方法，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了封闭世界假设的局限性，为城市移动预测提供了更灵活和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Conclusion: TripTailor有望推动旅行规划代理的发展，提升其理解用户需求并生成实用行程的能力。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Method: 提出MILP精确解和高效启发式方法，结合充电点可用性、成本等因素优化路线。

Result: 相比基准策略EDF和NDF，充电成本分别降低39%和22%，同时完成类似配送量。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在电动车辆配送中有效平衡充电成本和配送效率。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Result: WinkTPG在1秒内处理1000个智能体，性能提升51.7%。

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了MAPF计划动力学可行性和执行优化问题。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Result: 在多个数据集上，Refine-n-Judge增强的模型在74%的比较中优于原始数据集模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，显著提升模型性能，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Motivation: 传统方法在捕捉表格复杂关系和适应任务需求方面存在不足，而语言模型（尤其是大语言模型）为自动化表格数据准备提供了新机会。

Method: 系统分析了LMs在四个核心阶段的应用，提出了结合其他组件的集成方法和前瞻性流程。

Result: 展示了LMs在不同准备任务中的关键进展和潜在应用。

Conclusion: LMs在表格数据准备中具有显著潜力，但仍需系统性探索其有效使用方法。

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中复杂任务目标和安全约束的泛化问题，特别是嵌套长时程任务和不可满足子目标的情况。

Method: 利用Büchi自动机结构分解LTL任务为子目标序列，逐个解决子目标，并引入观察缩减技术降低复杂度。

Result: 实验显示GenZ-LTL在零样本泛化上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解和逐个解决子目标，有效提升了零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Motivation: 解决静态代理架构在复杂动态环境中的适应性不足问题，提供可扩展、动态且可解释的AI解决方案。

Method: 基于组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论，定义SPARK参数空间，利用LLMs参数化复杂空间并进行蒙特卡洛模拟。

Result: 在五级复杂度模拟中，发现适应性趋势和性能阈值，支持优化代理配置。

Conclusion: PCF为下一代多态代理提供可扩展、动态且符合伦理的框架，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Result: 19个LLMs的评估显示，随着任务复杂度增加，性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在语言流畅性和科学计算准确性之间存在差距，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为T-GRAG的动态时序感知RAG框架，通过建模知识的时间演化，解决了现有GraphRAG方法忽略知识时序动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法在知识密集型任务中因忽略知识的时间动态性，导致时间模糊性、时间不敏感检索和语义冗余等问题。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时序知识图谱生成器、时序查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有RAG和GraphRAG基线。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对鲁棒的长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过视觉、分布和上下文三个维度减少不确定性，提升医学报告生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学报告生成中的视觉、标签分布和上下文不确定性，以提高临床可信度。

Method: 采用Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块、Token Sensitive Learning目标和Contextual Evidence Filter。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中表现优异，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度减少不确定性，为医学报告生成提供了高可靠性的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏透明性，用户无法理解设计逻辑或优化不理想的输出。

Method: 设计了CoT推理流程，开发了自动标注数据集nvBench-CoT，并构建了交互式界面DeepVIS。

Result: 实验证明CoT框架显著提升了NL2VIS的质量，并为用户提供了可理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: CoT框架有效解决了NL2VIS中的透明性问题，同时提升了可视化效果。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力，解决了DFJSP问题中LLM直接应用的不足，显著优于基准方法和启发式规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调度规则效率高但缺乏灵活性，深度学习方法需要复杂特征工程且不透明。LLM虽具自适应推理潜力，但直接应用存在长上下文悖论、启发式利用不足和短视决策等问题。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，利用LLM分析多规划视野的启发式模拟，生成“战略经验”摘要，并集成到最终决策模块中。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基准（71.35%胜率，2.755%相对偏差减少），并超越所有评估的启发式规则。

Conclusion: ReflecSched有效解决了LLM在DFJSP中的关键问题，性能与针对每个实例的最佳启发式相当。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种可解释的概率推理框架，显著提升机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性，为自动化科学发现提供新思路。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Result: 实验证明该方法性能与现有求解器相当，并能有效扩展到大规模问题。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了开源求解器的空白，为生产者-消费者调度问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究推理系统提供了基础结构，特别是在内部失败、适应或分裂的背景下。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，输出聚合方法进一步提升了PRMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和方法为PRMs的高效数据构建和性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试局限于单服务器和少量工具，无法有效评估代理在大规模真实场景中的能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval评估框架，并设计MCP Copilot Agent进行动态规划和API交互。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但模型间性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为LLM代理在真实、工具丰富和动态环境中的评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖指标数据，误报率高且数据不平衡，导致运维负担重。LLM的进展为结合指标和日志数据提供了新机会。

Method: 提出CloudAnoAgent，联合处理结构化指标和文本日志数据，利用符号验证验证检测假设并生成结构化异常报告。

Result: 实验显示，CloudAnoAgent平均提升异常分类准确率46.36%和36.67%，降低误报率36.67%和33.89%，异常类型检测准确率提升12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent在提升检测准确性、降低误报和增强可解释性方面表现优异，适合企业云环境部署。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProKG Dial是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于构建高质量领域特定多轮对话数据集，显著提升对话质量和领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在专业领域缺乏精确性，构建高质量领域特定对话数据集是关键，但现有方法资源密集或质量受限。

Method: 利用知识图谱的结构化特性，通过社区检测和渐进式问答生成，结合严格过滤步骤，构建多轮对话数据集。

Result: 在医学知识图谱上验证，生成对话在多样性、语义连贯性和实体覆盖方面表现优异，微调后的模型显著优于基线。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial有效解决了领域特定对话数据集的构建问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动构建多轮自然语言到图查询语言（NL2GQL）数据集的方法，并开发了MTGQL数据集，以解决现有单轮转换方法在多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2GQL研究多关注单轮转换，而实际应用中用户与图数据库的交互是多轮、动态且依赖上下文的。缺乏高质量多轮数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 提出基于LLMs的自动化方法构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并开发了MTGQL数据集（基于金融市场图数据库）。同时提出三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL翻译效果。

Result: 成功构建并公开了MTGQL数据集，为多轮NL2GQL研究提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了多轮NL2GQL数据集的空白，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: SNOW是一种基于大型语言模型的模块化多代理系统，能够从非结构化临床笔记中自主生成结构化特征，无需人工干预，性能接近人工特征生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但现有方法（如人工特征生成或自动化特征生成）存在效率低或缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: SNOW通过多个专用代理（如特征发现、提取、验证等）利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自主生成结构化特征。

Result: 在预测前列腺癌复发任务中，SNOW性能（AUC-ROC: 0.761）接近人工特征生成（0.771），显著优于基线（0.691）和其他自动化方法。

Conclusion: SNOW展示了自主LLM系统可规模化复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Conclusion: AMADEUS框架为角色扮演问答提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

TL;DR: TraceAlign框架通过BCI指标和三种干预措施，显著减少LLM的对齐漂移，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM对齐漂移的根源，提出可追溯的解决方案。

Method: 引入BCI指标和三种干预措施（TraceShield、对比性损失、Prov-Decode）。

Result: 对齐漂移减少85%，任务性能影响小（delta<0.2）。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐漂移提供了可扩展的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Result: 在真实建筑数据上实验显示，GLM-4V的识别准确率提升至50%，提高了35.49%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了识别准确性、上下文理解和稳定性，为危险检测提供了新的理论和技术支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG提供了一种结构化、激励对齐的多代理协作方法，适用于可扩展和鲁棒的语言生成。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上实现55%的相对性能提升，达到最佳开源代理水平。

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自进化机制显著提升LLM代理的推理能力和任务解决效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly

Motivation: 解决现有机器人系统无法直接根据手绘草图生成3D结构的问题，为非专家用户提供便捷工具。

Method: 引入抽象关系图捕捉几何关系和稳定性模式，结合扩散模型生成3D姿态，并迭代更新隐藏支撑结构。

Result: 在标志性建筑和现代房屋设计中，StackItUp生成的3D结构稳定且视觉相似度高，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家用户提供了一种高效、稳定的从2D草图生成3D结构的方法。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在利用外部工具时表现出强大的推理和决策能力，但工具为中心的范式引入了新的攻击面：恶意工具可以通过操纵元数据优先被代理选择。

Method: 提出AMA攻击框架，通过迭代优化生成具有吸引力但语法和语义有效的工具元数据，无需修改代理执行框架。

Result: 在10个模拟工具使用场景和多种流行LLM代理上，攻击成功率达81%-95%，且对主任务执行影响极小。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击面，需在代理架构中引入执行级安全机制以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dynamic Mask Attention（DMA）的可训练动态掩码稀疏注意力机制，通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了信息完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为长上下文建模的瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力机制存在静态模式或信息丢失问题，因此需要一种更高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和实现位置感知稀疏注意力计算，自适应地聚焦关键信息并跳过不必要的计算区域。

Result: 实验表明，DMA在困惑度、多查询关联召回任务和1.7B参数模型评估中均优于多头注意力、滑动窗口注意力等方法。

Conclusion: DMA在模型效率和长上下文建模能力之间实现了出色的平衡，是一种高效的稀疏注意力机制。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于情感弧的游戏叙事生成框架，通过情感模式（上升和下降）指导分支故事图的生成，并在ARPG原型中验证了其提升玩家参与度和情感效果的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感弧是跨文化和媒体的普遍叙事结构，但如何将其应用于游戏叙事生成以增强互动性和情感效果尚待探索。

Method: 结合叙事学理论和实证分析，利用情感弧（上升和下降）生成分支故事图，并通过LLM和自适应实体生成实现。

Result: 玩家评分、访谈和情感分析表明，情感弧集成显著提升了游戏的参与度、叙事连贯性和情感效果。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的程序生成在互动叙事领域具有潜力，可推动游戏故事设计的进步。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但在指令跟随能力上存在不足，现有方法依赖外部模型，成本高且受限。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving but exhibit a concerning
trade off between reasoning capabilities and instruction following abilities.
Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger
external models, creating methodological bottlenecks and practical limitations
including increased costs and accessibility constraints. We propose a
self-supervised RL framework that leverages reasoning models' own internal
signals to improve instruction following capabilities without external
supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves instruction following capabilities while maintaining reasoning
performance, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to enhance
instruction following in reasoning models. The data and code are publicly

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双惩罚强化学习框架，通过区分内部冗余和外部冗余来减少大型推理模型（LRMs）的过度思考现象，显著压缩推理痕迹且几乎不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的过度思考现象（推理痕迹冗长）影响了效率和可解释性，现有方法仅关注减少响应长度，未深入分析推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 提出双惩罚强化学习框架：1）滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余（低贡献推理步骤）；2）惩罚外部冗余（正确解后的不必要延续）。

Result: 方法显著压缩推理痕迹，几乎不影响准确性，并能泛化到问答和代码生成等任务。外部冗余可安全移除，内部冗余需谨慎处理以避免损害正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升推理效率，还能隐式、语义感知地控制推理链长度，为更简洁、可解释的LRMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Method: 提出三部分架构（感知、辅助、执行系统），结合多频神经振荡和突触动态适应机制。

Result: 性能提升2.18%，计算迭代减少48.44%，更符合人类置信模式。

Conclusion: 该架构为类脑智能提供了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Result: 在随机网格世界和部分可观测的Minigrid任务中，该方法代理表现优于传统KL控制代理，展现出更稳健的规划和高效探索能力。

Conclusion: 该方法将主动推理理论与实际实现结合，验证了认知先验在人工代理中的高效性。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Conclusion: AirTrafficGen为ATC训练提供了可扩展的自动化方案，展示了LLMs在安全关键领域复杂规划中的潜力。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Conclusion: Traffic-R1为交通信号控制提供了高效、轻量且可解释的解决方案，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Result: OptiHive在复杂优化问题上表现优异，将最优率从5%提升至92%。

Conclusion: OptiHive提供了一种高效、可靠的优化问题求解方法，无需迭代自校正。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中生成的推理链（CoTs）存在冗余问题，原因是后训练过度依赖结果奖励范式，缺乏对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出PI框架，包含三个模块：When（何时干预）、How（如何干预）和Which（干预后采样），动态指导推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，PI显著缩短了推理链，减少了幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架通过整合人类问题解决经验和认知科学原理，提升了LLM推理的可控性和可解释性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:

planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a

HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/
