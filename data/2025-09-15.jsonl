This is a universal problem that also exists beyond\nsoftware engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must\nalso be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of\nnew metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness\nscores.

To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an\nLLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex\nloop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional\nspecification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each\nfunction into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby\nreducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion\nphase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate\nspecifications--especially those not easily identified by verification\ntool--while retaining valid ones.

We test 363 solutions to 9 coding\nproblems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting\ntechniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions.

Our empirical analysis\nreveals systemic non-compliance in which 35.5% of model-to-application\ntransitions eliminate restrictive license clauses by relicensing under\npermissive terms. In addition, we prototype an extensible rule engine that\nencodes almost 200 SPDX and model-specific clauses for detecting license\nconflicts, which can solve 86.4% of license conflicts in software applications.\nTo support future research, we release our dataset and the prototype engine.\nOur study highlights license compliance as a critical governance challenge in\nopen-source AI and provides both the data and tools necessary to enable\nautomated, AI-aware compliance at scale."}

Addressing this challenge\nrequires efficient issue detection, resolution, and evaluation tools. This\npaper presents WALL, a web application that integrates SonarQube and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o to automate these\ntasks. WALL comprises three modules: an issue extraction tool, code issues\nreviser, and code comparison tool. Together, they enable a seamless pipeline\nfor detecting software issues, generating automated code revisions, and\nevaluating the accuracy of revisions. Our experiments, conducted on 563 files\nwith over 7,599 issues, demonstrate WALL's effectiveness in reducing human\neffort while maintaining high-quality revisions. Results show that employing a\nhybrid approach of cost-effective and advanced LLMs can significantly lower\ncosts and improve revision rates. Future work aims to enhance WALL's\ncapabilities by integrating open-source LLMs and eliminating human\nintervention, paving the way for fully automated code quality management."}

This challenge is\namplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they\noperate as unauditable \"black boxes\" lacking a transparent reasoning process,\nand consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities.\nTo address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a\nnovel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins\nwith Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long\nChain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated\nreasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security\nanalysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ\nSecurity-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement\nlearning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted\nreward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format\ncorrectness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world\nfunctions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top\nperformance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a\nSafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This\nFullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline,\nDeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human\nevaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security\n(85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%)."}

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread\nadoption in development pipelines. Goal. We empirically assess the energy\nefficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code\ndeveloped by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding\nproblems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting\ntechniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption\nis measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a\nRaspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16%\nmore energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs\noutperform human developers by 25% on the PC. Prompting does not consistently\nlead to energy savings, where the most energy-efficient prompts vary by\nhardware platform. The code developed by a Green software expert is\nconsistently more energy-efficient by at least 17% to 30% against all LLMs on\nall hardware platforms. Conclusions. Even though LLMs exhibit relatively good\ncode generation capabilities, no LLM-generated code was more energy-efficient\nthan that of an experienced Green software developer, suggesting that as of\ntoday there is still a great need of human expertise for developing\nenergy-efficient Python code."}
