The\nalgorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large\nsuperpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule\nto guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --\nincorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem\nHamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is\nupdated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,\nwhich iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the\nspin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies\nglobal minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO\ninstances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku\npuzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with\nlong-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the\nalgorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving\ninstances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages\nof this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,\nand suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications."}

To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a\nlocally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier.

They are capable of\nautomatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,\nor destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment\nwith the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,\nor SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure\ndrift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may\nundo valid updates or trigger errors.\n  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates\nout-of-band changes back into the IaC program.

NSync gleans insights from API\ntraces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update\nthe IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic\narchitecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API\nsequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and\ncontinually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past\nreconciliations.

This is because of its\nincentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.\n  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC\n(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to\nmitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;\nhowever, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they\nconsider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the\ntransfer collude with the miner.\n  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by\npresenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and\ngame-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC\nthan He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking\nnaive HTLC.\n  Leveraging our insights, we propose \\prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC\nprotocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \\prot\\ employs a two-phase\napproach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as\nminers.

In addition, this paper proposes an\nadversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and\nattack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL\nin detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space,\naction space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the\nattacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness\ntraining strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training,\nrobust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related\ndefense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these\nmethods in improving the robustness of DRL. Finally, this paper looks into the\nfuture research direction of DRL in adversarial environments, emphasizing the\nresearch needs in terms of improving generalization, reducing computational\ncomplexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability, aiming to provide\nvaluable references and directions for researchers."}

Operating in dynamic\non-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app\ninteractions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector:\nenvironmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual\ninstructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by\ninserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed\nnotifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can\nderail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible\ndevice compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce\nGhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under\nenvironmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving\nbeyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events\ninto realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators\nand evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a\njudge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the\nagent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,\npinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to\ndeceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive\nand reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for\nquantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more\nrobust and secure embodied agents."}

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors."}

Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to\nwrite policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to\nprivate data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to\ntheir complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often\nimplement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to\nprecisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated\ncode synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be\nused for automatically generating access control policies or aid in\nunderstanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of\nLLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we\nfirst investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding\nthat: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,\nthey have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given\nspecification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time\nfor reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze\npolicies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach\nwhich leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests\nallowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles\nin leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results\nwhen combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies."}

To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of\nmodern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility\nalgorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example.
