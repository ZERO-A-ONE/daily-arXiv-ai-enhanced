Therefore, it is crucial\nto determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend\nto take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for\ndetecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)\ndifficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time.

A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground\nformulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking\ninspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a\nparametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward\nChaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly\nemployed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off\nbetween expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner.

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift."}

It enables LLM to execute\nprogrammatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.\nTherefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,\nwhich can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six\nbenchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,\nwith an average improvement of 7.95\\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.\nFurthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best\nperforming method at baseline by 58.3\\%. In addition, we demonstrate the\nversatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification\nexperiments."}

In this paper, we propose and\nempirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate\nproto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to\nevaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,\nand the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study\nwith 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative\nand quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency\nby reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of\npersonas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\nscoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially\nregarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations\nrelated to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although\ncognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy\nvaried significantly across participants. These results contribute novel\nempirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software\nProduct Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be\naddressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes."}

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift."}
