Submitted to a journal for publication", "summary": "This paper presents a robust image encryption and key distribution framework that integrates an enhanced AES-128 algorithm with chaos theory and advanced steganographic techniques for dual-layer security. The encryption engine features a dynamic ShiftRows operation controlled by a logistic map, variable S-boxes generated from a two-dimensional Henon map for substitution and key expansion, and feedback chaining with post-encryption XOR diffusion to improve confusion, diffusion, and key sensitivity. To address secure key delivery, the scheme introduces dual-key distribution via steganographically modified QR codes. A static key and an AES-encrypted dynamic session key are embedded with a covert hint message using least significant bit (LSB) steganography. This design ensures the dynamic key can only be decrypted after reconstructing the static key from the hidden message, offering multi-factor protection against interception. Experimental results demonstrate the framework outperforms existing chaos-based and hybrid AES methods, achieving near-ideal entropy (7.997), minimal pixel correlation, and strong differential resistance with NPCR (>99.6%) and UACI (50.1%). Encrypted images show uniform histograms and robustness against noise and data loss. The framework offers a scalable, secure solution for sensitive image transmission in applications such as surveillance, medical imaging, and digital forensics, bridging the gap between cryptographic strength and safe key distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3aAES-128\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9690\u5199\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u5b89\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e0e\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001ShiftRows\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u53ef\u53d8S-box\u548c\u53cc\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u654f\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5bc6\u94a5\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001ShiftRows\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u6c8c\u7406\u8bba\u7684S-box\u751f\u6210\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u94fe\u5f0f\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u53cc\u5bc6\u94a5\u9690\u5199\u5206\u53d1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u71b5\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\uff087.997\uff09\uff0c\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6297\u6570\u636e\u4e22\u5931\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u52a0\u5bc6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents an open-source, agent-based framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with HL7 FHIR data via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic extraction and reasoning over electronic health records (EHRs). Built on the established MCP-FHIR implementation, the framework enables declarative access to diverse FHIR resources through JSON-based configurations, supporting real-time summarization, interpretation, and personalized communication across multiple user personas, including clinicians, caregivers, and patients.

Traditional detection systems primarily focus on email metadata that users cannot see in their inboxes. Additionally, these systems struggle with phishing emails, which experienced users can often identify empirically by the text alone. This paper investigates the practical potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect these emails by focusing on their intent. In addition to the binary classification of phishing emails, the paper introduces an intent-type taxonomy, which is operationalized by the LLMs to classify emails into distinct categories and, therefore, generate actionable threat information. To facilitate our work, we have curated publicly available datasets into a custom dataset containing a mix of legitimate and phishing emails. Our results demonstrate that existing LLMs are capable of detecting and categorizing phishing emails, underscoring their potential in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9493\u9c7c\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800cLLM\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u90ae\u4ef6\u6587\u672c\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u5bf9\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u610f\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u90ae\u4ef6\u5206\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The router-based configuration achieved performance scores of 95.00% for shallow foundations and 90.63% for pile design, representing improvements of 8.75 and 3.13 percentage points over standalone Grok 3 performance respectively. The system outperformed conventional agentic workflows by 10.0 to 43.75 percentage points. Grok 3 demonstrated superior standalone performance without external computational tools, indicating advances in direct LLM mathematical reasoning for engineering applications. The dual-tier classification framework successfully distinguished foundation types, enabling appropriate analytical approaches.

Here, we extend the IS approach by introducing instruction and solution probabilities as additional heuristics. Instruction probability reflects the expectation of an instruction occurring in a solution, based on the frequency of instruction occurrence in a large code sample. The solution probability for a partial or complete program is simply the product of all constituent instruction probabilities, including duplicates. We treat the minimum solution probabilities observed in code sample program units of different sizes as solution probability thresholds. These thresholds are used to prune the search space as partial solutions are constructed, thereby eliminating any branches containing unlikely combinations of instructions. The new approach has been evaluated using a large sample of human code. We tested two formulations of instruction probability: one based on instruction occurrence across the entire code sample and another that measured the distribution separately for each IS. Our results show that both variants produce substantial further reductions in the IP search space size of up to tens of orders of magnitude, depending on solution size. In combination with IS, reductions of over 100 orders of magnitude can be achieved. We also carried out cross-validation testing to show that the heuristics should work effectively with unseen code.

By replacing traditional pseudorandom number generators with quantum entropy sources, we assess the impact on key security and performance metrics, including execution time, and resource usage. Our approach simulates a modified VRF setup where initialization keys are derived from a quantum random number generator source (QRNG). The results show that while QRNGs could enhance the unpredictability and verifiability of VRFs, their incorporation introduces challenges related to temporal and computational overhead. This study provides valuable insights into the trade-offs of leveraging quantum randomness in API-driven cryptographic systems and offers a potential path toward more secure and efficient protocol design. The QRNG-based system shows increased (key generation times from 50 to 400+ microseconds, verification times from 500 to 3500 microseconds) and higher CPU usage (17% to 30%) compared to the more consistent performance of a Go-based VRF (key generation times below 200 microseconds, verification times under 2000 microseconds, CPU usage below 10%), highlighting trade-offs in computational efficiency and resource demands.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eEd25519\u692d\u5706\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\uff08VRF\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bc6\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u6e90\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9\u5bc6\u94a5\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08QRNG\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347VRF\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728VRF\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u62df\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684VRF\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5bc6\u94a5\u6765\u81ea\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08QRNG\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "QRNG\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VRF\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0850\u81f3400+\u5fae\u79d2\uff09\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\uff08500\u81f33500\u5fae\u79d2\uff09\u589e\u52a0\uff0cCPU\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\uff0817%\u81f330%\uff09\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfGo-based VRF\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728VRF\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address this issue, coordination of multi access points (APs) has been considered to enable coordinated spatial reuse (CSR) in next generation wireless local area networks. This paper tackles the challenge of downlink spatial reuse in Wi-Fi networks, specifically in scenarios involving overlapping basic service sets, by employing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL). We decompose the CSR process into two phases, i.e., a polling phase and a decision phase, and introduce the HMARL algorithm to enable efficient CSR. To enhance training efficiency, the proposed HMARL algorithm employs a hierarchical structure, where station selection and power control are determined by a high- and low-level policy network, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of throughput and latency across various network topologies. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits robust performance when coexisting with legacy APs. Additional experiments in a representative topology further reveal that the carefully designed reward function not only maximizes the overall network throughput, but also improves fairness in transmission opportunities for APs in high-interference regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HMARL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6Wi-Fi\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u540c\u9891\u5e72\u6270\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8c03\u591aAP\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u534f\u8c03\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\uff08CSR\uff09\u5206\u4e3a\u8f6e\u8be2\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528HMARL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u7ad9\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfAP\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u5e72\u6270\u533a\u57dfAP\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HMARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

However, prior studies have shown that these models often incur significant computational costs due to excessive reasoning, such as frequent switching between reasoning trajectories (e.g., underthinking) or redundant reasoning on simple questions (e.g., overthinking). In this work, we expose a novel threat: adversarial inputs can be crafted to exploit excessive reasoning behaviors and substantially increase computational overhead without compromising model utility. Therefore, we propose a novel loss framework consisting of three components: (1) Priority Cross-Entropy Loss, a modification of the standard cross-entropy objective that emphasizes key tokens by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LMs; (2) Excessive Reasoning Loss, which encourages the model to initiate additional reasoning paths during inference; and (3) Delayed Termination Loss, which is designed to extend the reasoning process and defer the generation of final outputs. We optimize and evaluate our attack for the GSM8K and ORCA datasets on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen.

These findings suggest valuable mechanisms for human-LLM collaboration in tackling complex program synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPARC Challenge\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "IPARC Challenge\u7684600\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709IPARC\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u51bb\u7ed3\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

This study provides a rigorous evaluation of consensus power inequality across five prominent blockchain networks - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Hedera, and Algorand - using data collected from January 2022 to July 2024. Leveraging established economic metrics, including the Gini coefficient and Theil index, the research quantitatively assesses how power is distributed among blockchain network participants. A robust dataset, capturing network-specific characteristics such as mining pools, staking patterns, and consensus nodes, forms the foundation of the analysis, enabling meaningful comparisons across diverse architectures. Through an in-depth comparative study, the paper identifies key disparities in consensus power distribution. Hedera and Bitcoin demonstrate more balanced power distribution, aligning closely with the principles of decentralisation. Ethereum and Cardano demonstrate moderate levels of inequality. However, contrary to expectations, Ethereum has become more concentrated following its transition to Proof-of-Stake. Meanwhile, Algorand shows a pronounced centralisation of power. Moreover, the findings highlight the structural and operational drivers of inequality, including economic barriers, governance models, and network effects, offering actionable insights for more equitable network design. This study establishes a methodological framework for evaluating blockchain consensus power inequality, emphasising the importance of targeted strategies to ensure fairer power distribution and enhancing the sustainability of decentralised systems. Future research will build on these findings by integrating additional metrics and examining the influence of emerging consensus mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Hedera\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u5206\u5e03\u8f83\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u548cCardano\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0c\u800cAlgorand\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5171\u8bc6\u6743\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gini\u7cfb\u6570\u548cTheil\u6307\u6570\u7b49\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u67902022\u5e741\u6708\u81f32024\u5e747\u6708\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "Hedera\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u8f6c\u5411PoS\u540e\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cAlgorand\u6743\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5171\u8bc6\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

Existing detection approaches have focused on advancing model selection, evolving from traditional machine learning (ML) models to large language models (LLMs). However, as the complexity of the model increases, the time consumption also increases, which raises the question of whether a lightweight model achieves effective detection. Through empirical research, we demonstrate that collecting a sufficiently comprehensive feature set enables even traditional ML models to achieve outstanding performance. However, with the continuous emergence of new malicious packages, considerable human and material resources are required for feature analysis. Also, traditional ML model-based approaches lack of explainability to malicious packages.Therefore, we propose a novel approach MalGuard based on graph centrality analysis and the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) algorithm to detect malicious packages.To overcome the above two challenges, we leverage graph centrality analysis to extract sensitive APIs automatically to replace manual analysis. To understand the sensitive APIs, we further refine the feature set using LLM and integrate the LIME algorithm with ML models to provide explanations for malicious packages. We evaluated MalGuard against six SOTA baselines with the same settings. Experimental results show that our proposed MalGuard, improves precision by 0.5%-33.2% and recall by 1.8%-22.1%.

However, existing benchmarks exhibit several critical limitations: many tasks are overly simplistic, test cases often lack rigor, and end-to-end validation is absent. These issues hinder the accurate assessment of model performance. To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks.

Author version of article to appear at CCS 2025", "summary": "We show the security risk associated with using machine learning classifiers in United States election tabulators. The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.\n  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7968\u5668\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7968\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SVM\u3001CNN\u3001ViT\uff09\u3001\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b05%\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7968\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

While traditional heuristic approaches and integer linear programming (ILP) methods have demonstrated efficacy for small to medium-scale problems, their scalability to large-scale instances remains unknown. Here, we introduce quantum annealing (QA) as a subroutine to tackling multi-objective SBSE problems, leveraging the computational potential of quantum systems. We propose two QA-based algorithms tailored to different problem scales. For small-scale problems, we reformulate multi-objective optimization (MOO) as single-objective optimization (SOO) using penalty-based mappings for quantum processing. For large-scale problems, we employ a decomposition strategy guided by maximum energy impact (MEI), integrating QA with a steepest descent method to enhance local search efficiency. Applied to NRP and FSP, our approaches are benchmarked against the heuristic NSGA-II and the ILP-based $\u03b5$-constraint method. Experimental results reveal that while our methods produce fewer non-dominated solutions than $\u03b5$-constraint, they achieve significant reductions in execution time.

In particular, we use the Chain of Density (CoD) prompt to guide OpenAI GPT-4 to generate abstractive, semantically dense, and easily interpretable summaries of mobile app reviews. The CoD prompt is engineered to iteratively extract salient entities from the source text and fuse them into a fixed-length summary. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a large dataset of mobile app reviews. We further conduct an empirical evaluation with 48 study participants to assess the readability of the generated summaries. Our results demonstrate that adapting the CoD prompt to focus on app features improves its ability to extract key themes from user reviews and generate natural language summaries tailored for end-user consumption.

However, in a short period, a wave of backlash has led many firms to re-assess their DEI strategies. Responding to this DEI backlash is crucial in academic research, especially because, currently, little scholarly research has been done on it. In this paper, therefore, we have set forth the following research question (RQ): \"How have leading software companies changed their DEI strategies in recent years?\" Given the novelty of the RQ and, consequently, the lack of scholarly research on it, we are conducting a grey literature study, examining the current state of DEI initiatives in 10 leading software companies. Based on our analysis, we have classified companies into categories based on their shift in commitment to DEI. We can identify that companies are indeed responding to the backlash by rethinking their strategy, either by reducing, increasing, or renaming their DEI initiatives. In contrast, some companies keep on with their DEI strategy, at least so far, despite the challenging political climate.

However, these predicted fragments already contain bugs. Thus, the current bug prediction approaches support fixing rather than prevention. The aim of this paper is to introduce and evaluate Ticket-Level Prediction (TLP), an approach to identify tickets that will introduce bugs once implemented. We analyze TLP at three temporal points, each point represents a ticket lifecycle stage: Open, In Progress, or Closed. We conjecture that: (1) TLP accuracy increases as tickets progress towards the closed stage due to improved feature reliability over time, and (2) the predictive power of features changes across these temporal points. Our TLP approach leverages 72 features belonging to six different families: code, developer, external temperature, internal temperature, intrinsic, ticket to tickets, and JIT. Our TLP evaluation uses a sliding-window approach, balancing feature selection and three machine-learning bug prediction classifiers on about 10,000 tickets of two Apache open-source projects. Our results show that TLP accuracy increases with proximity, confirming the expected trade-off between early prediction and accuracy. Regarding the prediction power of feature families, no single feature family dominates across stages; developer-centric signals are most informative early, whereas code and JIT metrics prevail near closure, and temperature-based features provide complementary value throughout. Our findings complement and extend the literature on bug prediction at the class, method, or commit level by showing that defect prediction can be effectively moved upstream, offering opportunities for risk-aware ticket triaging and developer assignment before any code is written.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Ticket-Level Prediction (TLP)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u54ea\u4e9b\u5de5\u5355\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u540e\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5355\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff08Open\u3001In Progress\u3001Closed\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0TLP\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u5de5\u5355\u8fdb\u5c55\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u4fee\u590d\u800c\u975e\u9884\u9632\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7TLP\u5c06\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u524d\u5230\u5de5\u5355\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "TLP\u5229\u752872\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5206\u4e3a6\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2aApache\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7ea610,000\u4e2a\u5de5\u5355\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "TLP\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u5de5\u5355\u8fdb\u5c55\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u4ee3\u7801\u548cJIT\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5168\u7a0b\u8865\u5145\u3002", "conclusion": "TLP\u5c06\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u524d\u81f3\u5de5\u5355\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, leveraging their extensive knowledge to produce test code more efficiently. This study investigates the quality of Python test code generated by three LLMs: GPT-4o, Amazon Q, and LLama 3.3. We evaluate the structural reliability of test suites generated under two distinct prompt contexts: Text2Code (T2C) and Code2Code (C2C). Our analysis includes the identification of errors and test smells, with a focus on correlating these issues to inadequate design patterns. Our findings reveal that most test suites generated by the LLMs contained at least one error or test smell. Assertion errors were the most common, comprising 64% of all identified errors, while the test smell Lack of Cohesion of Test Cases was the most frequently detected (41%). Prompt context significantly influenced test quality; textual prompts with detailed instructions often yielded tests with fewer errors but a higher incidence of test smells. Among the evaluated LLMs, GPT-4o produced the fewest errors in both contexts (10% in C2C and 6% in T2C), whereas Amazon Q had the highest error rates (19% in C2C and 28% in T2C). For test smells, Amazon Q had fewer detections in the C2C context (9%), while LLama 3.3 performed best in the T2C context (10%). Additionally, we observed a strong relationship between specific errors, such as assertion or indentation issues, and test case cohesion smells. These findings demonstrate opportunities for improving the quality of test generation by LLMs and highlight the need for future research to explore optimized generation scenarios and better prompt engineering strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001Amazon Q\u548cLLama 3.3\u4e09\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684Python\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u65ad\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cGPT-4o\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u811a\u672c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u9519\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08Text2Code\u548cCode2Code\uff09\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u8054\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u65ad\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u536064%\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f02\u5473\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u5185\u805a\u529b\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\uff0841%\uff09\u3002GPT-4o\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\uff0cAmazon Q\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u5f85\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The course has undergone fundamental changes since 2020 to make the teaching approach more student-centred and flexible. As many universities abandoned having face-to-face exams at the end of the semester, authentic assessments now play an even more important role than before. This makes assessment of students' work even more challenging, especially if we are dealing with large cohorts of students. The complexity is not only in dealing with diversity in the student cohorts when elaborating the assessment tasks, but also in being able to provide feedback and marks in a timely and fairly. We report our lessons learned, which might provide useful insights for teaching Agile/Scrum concepts to undergraduate and postgraduate students. We also analyse what course structure might be effective to support a blended learning approach, as well as what could be a reasonable structure of online assessments, to keep them both authentic and scalable for large cohorts of students.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6559\u6388\u4e00\u95e8\u4ee5\u654f\u6377/Scrum\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e862020\u5e74\u540e\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u6539\u9769\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u75ab\u60c5\u540e\u6559\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u6388\u654f\u6377/Scrum\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6539\u9769\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language models (LLMs). We begin by extracting a taxonomy of migration scenarios from the different sources of official Qiskit documentation (such as release notes), capturing common patterns such as migration of functionality to different modules and deprecated usage. This taxonomy, along with the original Python source code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with identifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting appropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the context length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and reasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively assist in automating Qiskit code migration. This work contributes both a set of proven prompts and taxonomy for Qiskit code migration from earlier versions to version 0.46 and a methodology to asses the capabilities of LLMs to assist in the migration of quantum code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u91cd\u6784Qiskit\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u5b98\u65b9\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8f93\u5165LLM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9762\u4e34API\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u66f4\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u4eceQiskit\u5b98\u65b9\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8f93\u5165LLM\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u514b\u670dLLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316Qiskit\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u65e7\u7248\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u52300.46\u7248\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose IsComment, an issue-based LLM retrieval and verification approach for generating method's design rationale, usage directives, and so on as supplementary code comments. We first identify five main types of code supplementary information that issue reports can provide through code-comment-issue analysis. Next, we retrieve issue sentences containing these types of supplementary information and generate candidate code comments. To reduce hallucinations, we filter out those candidate comments that are irrelevant to the code or unverifiable by the issue report, making the code comment generation results more reliable. Our experiments indicate that compared with LLMs, IsComment increases the coverage of manual supplementary comments from 33.6% to 72.2% for ChatGPT, from 35.8% to 88.4% for GPT-4o, and from 35.0% to 86.2% for DeepSeek-V3.

However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6210\u4e3aAI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406USEagent\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6USEbench\u3002USEagent\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u80dc\u4efbAI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406USEagent\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u534f\u8c03\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6USEbench\u3002", "result": "USEagent\u57281,271\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "USEagent\u662f\u672a\u6765AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u96cf\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}
