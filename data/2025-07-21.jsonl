PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment.

Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy.

Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of\ncontinuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring\nconditions for smell accumulation.

In such attacks, instructions with malicious\npurposes are injected into external data sources, such as web documents. When\nLLMs retrieve this injected data through tools, such as a search engine and\nexecute the injected instructions, they provide misled responses. Recent attack\nmethods have demonstrated potential, but their abrupt instruction injection\noften undermines their effectiveness. Motivated by the limitations of existing\nattack methods, we propose TopicAttack, which prompts the LLM to generate a\nfabricated conversational transition prompt that gradually shifts the topic\ntoward the injected instruction, making the injection smoother and enhancing\nthe plausibility and success of the attack. Through comprehensive experiments,\nTopicAttack achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an attack success rate\n(ASR) over 90\\% in most cases, even when various defense methods are applied.\nWe further analyze its effectiveness by examining attention scores.

Hiser", "Anh Nguyen-Tuong", "Jack W. Davidson"], "title": "PHASE: Passive Human Activity Simulation Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and\nsandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no\nquantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user\npersonas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation\nEvaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs\nand distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\\% accuracy. PHASE\noperates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any\nuser-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network\nactivity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to\navoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt\nthe fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel\nlabeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic,\nthereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures\nindicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic\nuser persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral\nrealism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration\nthat significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a\nmore realistic and effective synthetic user persona."}

Reader discretion is\n  advised", "summary": "We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend\ndiffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their\nability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety\ncheckers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under\nadversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a\nbi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's\nability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and\nmaximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe\ndata. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while\nmaintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method\nsignificantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while\nmaintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for\ncreating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial\nfine-tuning attacks."}

With their advanced language\nunderstanding and contextual reasoning, LLMs surpass traditional methods in\ntackling challenges across domains such as IoT, blockchain, and hardware\nsecurity. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM applications in\ncybersecurity, focusing on two core areas: (1) the integration of LLMs into key\ncybersecurity domains, and (2) the vulnerabilities of LLMs themselves, along\nwith mitigation strategies. By synthesizing recent advancements and identifying\nkey limitations, this work offers practical insights and strategic\nrecommendations for leveraging LLMs to build secure, scalable, and future-ready\ncyber defense systems."}
