In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with\nstructured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic\nplanningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,\nlanguage-driven automation in chemical engineering."}

Biases,\noften arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,\ncompromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers\nare less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made\nstrides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the\ncritical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more\nrobust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on\nbiased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive\nsampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It\naddresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and\nsampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of\nall classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further\npropose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to\nassess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction.

In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate\nrequirements generation in the space domain.

These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive."}
