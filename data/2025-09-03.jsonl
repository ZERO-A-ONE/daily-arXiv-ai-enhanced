Recent studies have shown that GPU\nkernels are vulnerable to both traditional memory safety issues (e.g., buffer\noverflow attacks) and emerging microarchitectural threats (e.g., Rowhammer\nattacks), many of which manifest as anomalous execution behaviors observable\nthrough side-channel signals. However, existing golden model based validation\napproaches that rely on such signals are fragile, highly sensitive to\ninterference, and do not scale well across GPU workloads with diverse\nscheduling behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ShadowScope, a\nmonitoring and validation framework that leverages a composable golden model.\nInstead of building a single monolithic reference, ShadowScope decomposes\ntrusted kernel execution into modular, repeatable functions that encode key\nbehavioral features. This composable design captures execution patterns at\nfiner granularity, enabling robust validation that is resilient to noise,\nworkload variation, and interference across GPU workloads. To further reduce\nreliance on noisy software-only monitoring, we introduce ShadowScope+, a\nhardware-assisted validation mechanism that integrates lightweight on-chip\nchecks into the GPU pipeline.

Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the\ndiverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem\nfrom benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior.\nExisting data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from\nnatural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering\nperformance.\n  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation\n(RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and\nmitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system\nemploys code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical\nvariables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted\ntraining recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an\nattestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted\nto the server.

To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities.

However, hallucination\nissues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that\nOmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also\nsignificantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.\nAll code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance."}

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier\ndesigned to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating\ndiverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from\nConjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems\nalong three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question\nformat, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer\nverification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for\nnuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective\nreinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using\nSATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,\nparticularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats.

This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while\nrepeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds\nsignificant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which\nfocuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,\nwhich focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an\ninterplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates\nself-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum\nlogic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,\ngiving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to\nquantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are\nformed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed\nquantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for\ncontrolling spike waves and biochemical rhythms."}

These systems are used in\nmany applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive\nmaterial.

The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems\n(IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical\ninfrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to\nsafeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common\nattack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm\nthe system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient\nMachine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing\non DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a\nsimulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an\nevaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector\nMachine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine\n(LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs.

Additionally, model\noptimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel\nexecution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the\nproposed IDS.

However, it focuses on frequency estimation over\ncategorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain\ndue to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.\n  In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP\nprotocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME\nprotocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately\ncalculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of\ninteraction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates\nwithin a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to\nmore advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique\nto reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol\nprovides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy,\nand efficiency.

The user then unblinds the signed message to obtain a valid\nsignature that can be verified publicly, ensuring that the signer cannot trace\nthe signed message back to the original unblinded version.

Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight\ntwo major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the\nengineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,\nand the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search\nfor novel solutions."}

Additionally, we utilize a trusted\ntraining recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an\nattestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted\nto the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client\ntraining processes remain free from program behavior violation or data\nmanipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the\nglobal model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel\nensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime\nand memory overhead."}

Unlike software flaws, which are\noften patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across\nproduct lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices,\nand IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021)\nrelied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and\nintroduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for\nhardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose\nLLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction\nand refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot\nLLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and\nprompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying\nLLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742\nhardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes,\nincluding privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in\nmobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven\nLLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy\n(99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our\nframework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses\n(MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our\npipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis,\nthereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These\nresults establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for\nsystematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence."}

However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query\nconstraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a\nconstrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a\nfunctional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i)\nreconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under\n10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits,\nthen (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with\nvarying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer\nstudent recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry,\nwith only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood\n(NLL).

In this paper, we\npropose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to\nvisit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that\nencompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution,\netc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting,\nparameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to\nexploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments\non these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only\nexhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures\nbut also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for\ncomplex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher\nexposure risks.
