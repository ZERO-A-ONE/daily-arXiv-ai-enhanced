This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to\nsystematically refactoring code.

While Ellingsen et al. (IEEE\nTrans. Inf.

We prove that the inner $c$-differential uniformity of a function $F$\nequals the outer $c$-differential uniformity of $F^{-1}$, establishing a\nfundamental duality. This modification preserves cipher structure while\nenabling practical cryptanalytic applications.\n  Our main contribution is a comprehensive multi-faceted\nstatistical-computational framework, implementing truncated $c$-differential\nanalysis against the full 9-round Kuznyechik cipher (the inner\n$c$-differentials are immune to the key whitening at the backend). Through\nextensive computational analysis involving millions of differential pairs, we\ndemonstrate statistically significant non-randomness across all tested round\ncounts.

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79.

Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

Business process prediction using reinforcement\n  learning and heterogeneous graph neural networks", "summary": "Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing\nbusiness processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices\nenvironments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which\nenables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nRLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process\ngraphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining\ntheory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential\nand non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive\nevaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the\nhighest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON\nrepresentation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid\nplan directly.

Extracting metadata from regulations to\nelicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.\nHowever, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal\ntext. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting\nstructural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they\ndo not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes\nassociated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or\nheuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new\ndocuments. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment\nand in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation\nof legal text, encodable and executable as Python code.

Among these, LLM email agent apps represent\none of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication\nmedium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to\nemail using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions\nvia external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing\ndeployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains\nunderexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential\nsecurity risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of\nLLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which\noverrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,\nallowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further\nperform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.\n  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to\nevaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps.

Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend\nredundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to\nidentify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more\nconcise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that\nTH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%\non hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs\nexhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,\nreflection).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTH2T\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347LRMs\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLRMs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5355\u4e00\u5316\u3002", "method": "TH2T\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u96be\u5ea6\u50ac\u7720\uff08difficulty-hypnosis\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5197\u4f59\u50ac\u7720\uff08redundancy-hypnosis\uff09\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTH2T\u57287B/14B/32B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff08\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u51cf\u5c1170%\uff0c\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "TH2T\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aLRMs\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "StepHint\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684RLVR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd1\u5931\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u5931\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "StepHint\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "StepHint\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6RLVR\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u57df\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "StepHint\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RLVR\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
