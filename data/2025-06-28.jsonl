However,\ntoday, it is difficult for operators to experiment, explore, and evaluate\ndeception approaches. Existing tools and platforms have non-portable and\ncomplex implementations that are difficult to modify and extend. We address\nthis pain point by introducing Perry, a high-level framework that accelerates\nthe design and exploration of deception what-if scenarios. Perry has two\ncomponents: a high-level abstraction layer for security operators to specify\nattackers and deception strategies, and an experimentation module to run these\nattackers and defenders in realistic emulated networks. To translate these\nhigh-level specifications we design four key modules for Perry: 1) an action\nplanner that translates high-level actions into low-level implementations, 2)\nan observability module to translate low-level telemetry into high-level\nobservations, 3) an environment state service that enables environment agnostic\nstrategies, and 4) an attack graph service to reason about how attackers could\nexplore an environment. We illustrate that Perry's abstractions reduce the\nimplementation effort of exploring a wide variety of deception defenses,\nattackers, and environments. We demonstrate the value of Perry by emulating 55\nunique deception what-if scenarios and illustrate how these experiments enable\noperators to shed light on subtle tradeoffs."}

It enables essential security- and development-related\napplications such as fuzzing communication interfaces, extracting session keys,\nmonitoring hidden SIM activity (e.g., proactive SIM commands or over-the-air\nupdates), and facilitating scalable, distributed measurement platforms through\nSIM reuse. Traditionally, achieving these capabilities has relied on\nspecialized hardware, which can pose financial and logistical burdens for\nresearchers, particularly those new to the field. In this work, we show that\nfull SIM tracing functionality can be achieved using only simple, widely\navailable components, such as UART interfaces and GPIO ports. We port these\ncapabilities to low-cost microcontrollers, exemplified by the Raspberry Pi Pico\n(4~USD).

To address this barrier, we\npropose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and\ncollaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks.

However, RL\nmethods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,\nhuman guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach\nand technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided\nby potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to\nbe mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal\nMT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,\nsubstantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient\ndevelopment of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and\ntimeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven\nhuman-in-the-loop engineering methods."}

Our prototype provides tailored\nviews for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'\ncontent and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts\nand lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different\nexplanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to\nincrease transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,\ninteractivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on\nAI explanation practices and human-AI interaction."}

However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue\nsafety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address\nthese issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological\ncounseling large language model agent developed based on the base model\nInternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation\ndata fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the\nmodel's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe\ndialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom\nworkflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed\nto introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological\ncounseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to\nstrengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the\nbaseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological\ncounseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation\n(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism\n(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\\%) and dialogue safety (\\safe{} score\nimprovement of 2.4\\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology\n(GGUF q4\\_k\\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient\nfor operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling\napplications in resource-constrained environments."}

With the daily increases in data\nvolumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and\nretrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become\nincreasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and\nRepresentation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address\nthese challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this\nmethodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j\ndatabases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate\ndata from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches\noften require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not\nbe familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to\nbridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes\nPython and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our\nnovel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)\ndatabase. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically\ngenerates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother\nintegration process.

Pertinent examples of\nsuch problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design\nspace exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often\ninfeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate\nthese issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial\nand error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL\nmethods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,\nhuman guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach\nand technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided\nby potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to\nbe mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal\nMT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,\nsubstantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient\ndevelopment of complex MTs.

We introduce ZKPROV, a novel\ncryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.\nIt allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without\nrevealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior\napproaches that focus on complete verification of the training process\n(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution\nenvironments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically\nbinds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through\nzero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By\nleveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,\nZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the\nLLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant\ndataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the\nZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical\nsolution for real-world deployments.

This paper presents Synthline v1,\nan enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data\nthat extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and\ncuration techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how\nprompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation\ncuration affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect\ndetection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security\nvs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting\nsignificantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,\nwith F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic\nEditing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,\ngreatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing\nperformance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves\ndiversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some\nredundancy may help ML models.
