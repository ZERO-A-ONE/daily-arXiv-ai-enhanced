While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they\noften suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in\nstagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this\npaper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates\nlightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.\nTestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and\nimproves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target\nline instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close\ntest cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the\ntarget line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and\n(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode\nvariable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these\ntargeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test\ngeneration and mitigates redundant explorations.

While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios.

JC-Finder achieves\nboth accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by\ncapturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function\nrelationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the\nefficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as\nreference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result\nshows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other\nfunction-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is\n14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We\nfurther applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code\nclones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of\n2,142 TPLs. JC-Finder successfully detects 26.20% more TPLs that are not\nexplicitly declared in package managers."}

This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire\nthe capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long\ncontexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly\nimproves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts\nin long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains."}

For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise.

A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x\n10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the\nrecovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean\nand cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error\nbounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally."}

To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework.

We propose\nRouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the\ndesign of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific\nexperts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.\nTo capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two\ncomplementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the\nintensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),\ncharacterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each\nexpert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and\nlightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce\na similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between\na suspect and a reference (victim) model.

Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,\nincluding passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server\nproactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones.
