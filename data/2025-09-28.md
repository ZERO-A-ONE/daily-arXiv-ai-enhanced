### [1] [ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20380)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM是专门为生成OpenACC指令而微调的两个开源大语言模型，能够自动为数据并行循环生成专家级OpenACC指令，显著降低了GPU编程的门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU硬件和并行编程框架日益复杂，虽然OpenACC等基于指令的并行编程标准在一定程度上简化了GPU编程，但仍需要相当的专业知识才能有效使用这些指令。

Method: 构建了包含4,033个OpenACC pragma-loop对的有监督微调数据集，其中3,223对用于训练，810对用于测试，并基于此数据集对LLM进行微调。

Result: 微调后的LLM在测试集上能够为87%的数据并行循环生成具有正确指令类型的有效pragma，为50%的情况生成完全正确的pragma（包括指令、子句、子句顺序和子句变量）。

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM显著提升了LLM生成OpenACC指令的能力，为自动化GPU卸载串行程序建立了可复现的基准，降低了GPU编程的门槛。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

### [3] [Dynamic ReAct: Scalable Tool Selection for Large-Scale MCP Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20386)
*Nishant Gaurav,Adit Akarsh,Ankit Ranjan,Manoj Bajaj*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Dynamic ReAct是一种新方法，使ReAct智能体能够在包含数百或数千个工具的MCP工具集中高效运行，通过搜索加载机制减少50%的工具加载量，同时保持任务完成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在包含大量可用工具的环境中，由于大语言模型上下文内存限制而无法同时加载所有工具的根本挑战。

Method: 提出并评估了五种不同的架构，逐步优化工具选择过程，最终实现搜索加载机制，以最小计算开销实现智能工具选择。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法减少工具加载量达50%，同时保持任务完成准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了真正通用AI智能体的发展，使其能够动态适应多样化任务环境。

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

### [4] [Towards Systematic Specification and Verification of Fairness Requirements: A Position Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20387)
*Qusai Ramadan,Jukka Ruohonen,Abhishek Tiwari,Adam Alami,Zeyd Boukhers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于知识图谱的公平性框架，用于规范和验证软件系统中的公平性需求，解决因缺乏明确公平性要求而导致的歧视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将软件系统中的歧视归因于算法设计缺陷或数据偏见，但忽视了公平性需求规范不明确及其验证缺失的根本问题。专家知识往往隐含，难以转化为精确可验证的公平性要求。

Method: 借鉴安全工程领域的成功经验，提出开发基于知识图谱的框架来形式化公平性知识，辅助需求规范和验证。

Result: 本文提出了研究挑战、研究问题以及解决这些问题的路线图，为构建公平性知识图谱框架奠定基础。

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法有望为软件系统公平性需求的形式化规范和验证提供有效机制，填补当前研究空白。

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

### [5] [Online-Optimized RAG for Tool Use and Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20415)
*Yu Pan,Xiaocheng Li,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了Online-Optimized RAG框架，通过在线梯度更新持续优化检索嵌入，解决实际应用中因嵌入模型不完美或描述噪声导致的嵌入不对齐问题，提升工具选择准确性和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成(RAG)在实际应用中因嵌入模型不完美或描述噪声导致的嵌入不对齐问题，这种不对齐可能导致错误检索和任务失败。

Method: 引入Online-Optimized RAG框架，通过轻量级在线梯度更新持续适应来自实时交互的检索嵌入，仅需最小反馈(如任务成功)，无需改变底层LLM，支持单跳和多跳工具使用、动态工具库和K检索重排序。

Result: 在多样化的工具使用和文档检索场景中，Online-Optimized RAG持续提高了工具选择准确性和最终任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建稳健、自我改进的RAG系统提供了一条简单实用的路径，通过问题依赖的理论分析量化了嵌入初始化质量对性能的影响。

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

*Reiner Hähnle,Cosimo Laneve,Adele Veschetti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Stipula是一种用于建模法律合同的领域特定语言，本文提出通过将其转换为带有JML规范的Java代码，并使用KeY工具自动验证合同正确性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了正式验证涉及资产转移和义务的法律合同的可执行属性，确保合同建模的正确性。

Method: 将Stipula合同翻译为带有Java建模语言规范的Java代码，并使用KeY演绎验证工具作为验证后端。

Result: 对于具有不相交循环的大型Stipula合同子集，翻译和部分及完全正确性验证都能完全自动化实现。

Conclusion: 研究表明通用演绎验证工具在翻译方法中可以成功应用，为法律合同的形式化验证提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

### [7] [AI-Specific Code Smells: From Specification to Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20491)
*Brahim Mahmoudi,Naouel Moha,Quentin Stievenert,Florent Avellaneda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SpecDetect4AI是一个基于工具的方法，用于大规模规范化和检测AI特定代码异味，通过声明性DSL和静态分析工具在826个AI系统中实现88.66%精确度和88.89%召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的兴起带来了新的软件问题，现有检测工具往往无法发现AI特定的代码异味，如不可复现性、静默故障或模型泛化能力差等问题。

Method: 结合高级声明性领域特定语言(DSL)进行规则规范，以及可扩展的静态分析工具来解析和检测AI系统中的这些规则。

Result: 在826个AI系统(2000万行代码)上评估，指定了22个AI特定代码异味，达到88.66%精确度和88.89%召回率，优于现有检测工具，系统可用性评分81.7/100。

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI通过专用规则支持AI特定代码异味的规范和检测，能够有效分析大型AI系统，展示了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

### [8] [PromptDebt: A Comprehensive Study of Technical Debt Across LLM Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20497)
*Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 首次大规模实证研究LLM集成中的技术债务，发现OpenAI集成占54.49%的债务，提示设计是主要来源，指令式提示和少样本提示最易产生债务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM通过API嵌入软件，这些集成带来了特定形式的技术债务，需要系统研究其来源、普遍性和缓解策略。

Method: 分析93,142个Python文件中的LLM API使用，识别技术债务实例并分类其来源。

Result: 54.49%的技术债务来自OpenAI集成，12.35%来自LangChain；提示设计是主要债务来源(6.61%)，指令式提示(38.60%)和少样本提示(18.13%)最易产生债务。

Conclusion: LLM集成带来了显著的技术债务，主要源于提示设计问题，需要专门的管理策略和工具支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

*Sayed Mahbub Hasan Amiri,Md Mainul Islam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于AI-Python的聊天机器人，通过结合静态代码分析、动态执行追踪和大型语言模型，帮助学生解决编程问题，提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程工具如IDE和静态分析器缺乏实时指导，而AI代码助手如GitHub Copilot主要关注代码完成而非教育。需要填补这一空白，提供既能解决问题又能促进学习的工具。

Method: 采用混合架构：使用CodeLlama进行代码嵌入，GPT-4处理自然语言交互，Docker沙箱确保安全执行。结合静态代码分析和动态执行追踪技术。

Result: 在1500份学生提交中，系统达到85%的错误解决成功率，优于pylint(62%)和GPT-4(73%)。调试时间减少59.3%，编程能力提升34%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI工具如何在编程教育中平衡技术创新与教学关怀，优先考虑教育公平和长期技能保持，而不仅仅是代码完成，促进更深层次的概念理解。

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

### [10] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc是一个基于大语言模型和检索增强生成的方法级故障定位框架，通过功能提取、语义检索和重排序三个组件，在Defects4J基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的故障定位方法在处理复杂系统时存在项目特定知识缺乏和大型项目导航困难的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: FaR-Loc包含三个关键组件：LLM功能提取模块生成失败行为的自然语言描述；语义密集检索组件在共享语义空间中嵌入功能描述和覆盖方法；LLM重排序模块基于上下文相关性重新排序检索到的方法。

Result: 在Defects4J基准测试中，FaR-Loc在Top-1准确率上比SoapFL和AutoFL分别高出14.6%和9.1%，在Top-5准确率上分别高出19.2%和22.1%，且无需重新训练即可超越所有基于学习和基于频谱的基线方法。

Conclusion: FaR-Loc通过结合LLM和RAG技术有效提升了故障定位性能，特别是包含代码结构的预训练代码嵌入模型可以显著改善定位效果，为实际应用提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet
dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75
in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a
reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis
and data-driven software engineering.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多模态方法测量混合会议中的参与度，发现现场和远程参与者的参与度相当，但远程参与者在长会议中参与度较低。主动角色与更高参与度相关，而大型会议和下午时段则与较低参与度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行后混合工作的广泛采用从根本上改变了软件开发实践，在从传统办公室结构向灵活工作安排过渡的过程中引入了沟通和协作的新挑战。远程参与会议可能导致远程团队成员的孤立、疏离和参与度降低。

Method: 研究了三家软件公司的专业人士数周时间，采用多模态方法测量参与度。通过自我报告问卷和生物识别设备的生理测量收集混合会议期间的数据。

Result: 回归分析显示现场和远程参与者的参与度水平相当，但远程参与者在长会议中无论参与模式如何都表现出较低的参与度。主动角色与更高参与度呈正相关，而大型会议和下午时段与较低参与度相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了关于混合会议中参与和脱离相关因素的见解，以及潜在的会议改进建议。这些见解不仅对软件团队相关，也适用于面临类似混合协作挑战的各行业知识密集型组织。

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

*Srishti Gureja,Elena Tommasone,Jingyi He,Sara Hooker,Matthias Gallé,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成数据的验证瓶颈问题，发现当前验证方法过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性。通过分析验证设计策略，提出了校准验证与多样化问题-解决方案对相结合的方法来突破验证天花板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成模型越来越依赖合成数据，但合成验证器的能力限制了训练数据的质量和多样性，形成了验证瓶颈。需要系统研究验证设计如何影响模型性能。

Method: 系统研究验证策略：(1)分析测试复杂度和数量的影响；(2)探索放宽通过阈值和LLM软验证；(3)通过控制比较和人工评估验证必要性。

Result: 更丰富的测试套件平均提升3个pass@1点；放宽验证阈值可恢复有价值训练数据，提升2-4个pass@1点；保留多样化正确解决方案带来一致泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证过于严格，但不能完全丢弃。通过校准验证与多样化问题-解决方案对相结合，可以突破验证天花板，解锁更强的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PseudoBridge是一个新颖的代码检索框架，通过引入伪代码作为中间模态来弥合自然语言查询与编程语言代码之间的语义鸿沟，提升检索准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练语言模型的代码搜索方法面临两个关键挑战：人类意图与机器执行逻辑之间的语义鸿沟，以及对不同代码风格的有限鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）使用大语言模型生成伪代码，显式对齐自然语言查询与伪代码；2）引入逻辑不变代码风格增强策略，生成风格多样但逻辑等价的代码实现，并与伪代码对齐。

Result: 在10个不同预训练语言模型和6种主流编程语言上的实验表明，PseudoBridge显著优于基线方法，在检索准确性和泛化能力方面取得显著提升，特别是在零样本领域迁移场景下。

Conclusion: 通过伪代码实现显式逻辑对齐是有效的，PseudoBridge展现了作为鲁棒、可泛化代码检索解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

TL;DR: CodeHinter是一个结合传统调试工具和LLM技术的调试助手，旨在帮助编程新手修复语义错误，同时促进他们在调试过程中的积极参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI调试工具容易导致学生对AI过度依赖，未能真正让学生参与调试过程。需要设计一个既能有效修复错误又能促进主动学习的调试工具。

Method: 结合传统调试工具和基于LLM的技术，设计CodeHinter调试助手，并通过与本科生进行测试来验证第二版设计的有效性。

Result: 学生认为该工具在解决语义错误方面非常有效，使用起来比第一版显著更容易。错误定位是最有价值的功能。

Conclusion: AI辅助调试工具应根据用户画像进行个性化定制，以优化与学生的互动效果。

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Stack Overflow上的量子计算问题，识别了量子软件工程的主要挑战类别，并使用Transformer模型实现了95%的分类准确率，优于传统深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子开发者在优化量子计算和量子软件工程概念时面临挑战，他们使用Stack Overflow讨论这些问题，但现有标签主要关注技术方面而非开发者实际遇到的问题。

Method: 从问答平台提取2829个量子相关问题，通过内容分析和扎根理论识别常见挑战类别，使用ChatGPT验证标注，并比较了BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa等Transformer模型与传统深度学习模型的分类性能。

Result: 识别出工具、理论、学习、概念、错误和API使用等主要挑战类别。Transformer模型平均准确率达到95%，比传统深度学习模型（FNN 89%、CNN 86%、LSTM 84%）高出6%。

Conclusion: Transformer方法在量子软件工程挑战分类中表现优异，SHAP分析增强了模型可解释性。这些发现有助于量子供应商和论坛更好地组织讨论，但需要与真实开发者和供应商进行实证评估。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

TL;DR: MelcotCR是一种基于思维链的微调方法，通过长思维链技术为代码审查提供丰富的结构化信息，使LLM能够同时分析代码审查的多个维度，显著提升代码问题检测和描述的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于微调的代码审查方法受限于训练数据的有限性或模糊性，无法像人类审查者那样同时分析代码审查的多个维度来更好地识别问题。

Method: 提出MelcotCR方法，结合最大熵建模原则和预定义推理路径，解决LLM处理长思维链提示时的上下文丢失和推理逻辑丢失问题，更有效地利用长思维链提示中的上下文知识并加强推理过程的逻辑严密性。

Result: 在MelcotCR数据集和公开CodeReviewer数据集上的实证评估显示，使用MelcotCR微调的14B Qwen2.5基础模型在检测和描述代码问题准确性方面超越了现有最先进方法，其性能与671B DeepSeek-R1模型相当。

Conclusion: MelcotCR方法通过思维链微调显著提升了LLM在代码审查任务中的推理能力，证明了即使是参数较少的模型，通过适当的微调方法也能达到与大型模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台上的公民参与日益重要，但由于贡献数量庞大，手动分类不可行，需要专家参与且要与官方分类法对齐，导致大量参与未被充分利用。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模、种子词引导和大型语言模型的自动验证，以最小化人工干预的方式生成与机构对齐的连贯主题。

Result: 初步结果表明，生成的主题具有连贯性且与机构分类对齐，仅需极少的人工努力。

Conclusion: 该方法使政府能够有效处理大规模公民输入，将其转化为公共政策的可操作数据，解决了公民参与平台上的分类挑战。

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

Motivation: 现有防御方法失败的原因在于使用了与后门攻击松散耦合的经验统计度量，无法有效应对3DFed等自适应优化的先进攻击。

Method: 提出MARS防御框架：1）使用后门能量指示神经元恶意程度；2）提取最显著的后门能量值形成集中后门能量；3）引入基于Wasserstein距离的聚类方法识别后门模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MARS能够有效防御最先进的后门攻击，性能显著优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: MARS通过更紧密地耦合后门攻击特征，成功解决了现有防御方法在对抗自适应后门攻击时的不足。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: R1-Fuzz是一个利用强化学习专门化成本效益语言模型进行复杂文本模糊测试输入生成的框架，通过覆盖切片问题构建和基于距离的奖励计算，使小型模型在真实世界模糊测试中能与更大模型竞争甚至超越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试在复杂目标（如编译器、解释器、数据库引擎）中效果有限，这些目标需要满足复杂语法和语义约束的文本输入。虽然语言模型有潜力，但实际应用受限于对深层程序逻辑探索不足和大型模型成本高昂的问题。

Method: 提出R1-Fuzz框架，使用强化学习专门化成本效益语言模型，包含两个关键设计：覆盖切片问题构建和基于距离的奖励计算。通过RL后训练构建的数据集，设计紧密集成语言模型的模糊测试工作流。

Result: 评估显示，R1-Fuzz-7B小模型在真实世界模糊测试中能与更大模型竞争甚至超越，比最先进模糊测试工具覆盖率高75%，发现了29个先前未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: R1-Fuzz证明了通过强化学习专门化小型语言模型在复杂文本模糊测试中的实用性，能够有效发现深层程序语义并识别漏洞。

Abstract: Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

TL;DR: 本文开发并应用了一个专家验证的隐私评分卡，对5个主流AI编程助手进行隐私保护评估，发现工具间存在20分的隐私保护差距，揭示了行业普遍存在的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI编程助手在开发者工作流程中的快速集成引发了严重的隐私和信任问题，开发者将专有代码托付给这些服务时，其不明确的数据处理实践带来了安全和合规风险。

Method: 通过分析四种文档类型（从法律政策到外部审计），基于14个加权标准对5个领先的AI编程助手进行评分，这些标准和权重由法律专家和数据保护官员完善。

Result: 评估结果显示隐私保护存在明显的层次结构，最高分和最低分工具之间有20分的差距，发现了行业普遍弱点，包括普遍使用选择退出同意进行模型训练，以及几乎普遍未能主动过滤用户提示中的秘密信息。

Conclusion: 该评分卡为开发者和组织提供了可操作的指导，建立了透明度新基准，并倡导AI行业向更以用户为中心的隐私标准转变。

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense
sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the
increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication
protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging
due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple
sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and
interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a
focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We
present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models,
namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on
a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types.
Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value
imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and
extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews
Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate
the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence
intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME,
were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance,
enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed
approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures
interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical
drone operations.

the hard challenge of the communication latency overhead across space.
Decentralized architectures are better alternatives in the longer term,

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对神经网络隐写恶意软件（stegomalware）的首个有效防御方法，通过重排权重矩阵的列顺序或卷积层的通道顺序，在不影响网络精度的情况下有效破坏嵌入的恶意载荷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在生产系统和个人使用中的广泛应用，网络检查点经常在各种平台上共享和分发。这带来了神经网络隐写恶意软件的安全威胁，即恶意软件以可忽略的精度代价嵌入到神经网络检查点中，而这一威胁目前被深度学习从业者和安全专家普遍忽视。

Method: 提出通过重排权重矩阵和偏置矩阵的列顺序（或卷积层的通道顺序）来防御神经网络隐写恶意软件攻击。这种方法能够有效破坏通过最先进隐写方法嵌入的恶意载荷，同时不影响网络精度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效破坏最先进神经网络隐写方法嵌入的恶意载荷，性能显著优于竞争方法，且不会对网络精度造成任何损失。

Conclusion: 该防御方法为神经网络安全提供了有效解决方案，同时讨论了可能的绕过防御手段和额外防御方法，呼吁继续研究机器学习系统的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

TL;DR: 语音深度伪造检测器在现实部署中面临"覆盖债务"问题，由于设备、采样率、编解码器、环境和攻击家族的变化，导致检测盲点快速增加，最坏情况性能而非平均基准分数决定安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示语音深度伪造检测器在开放世界部署中的覆盖债务问题，强调仅依赖检测不足以应对高安全风险场景。

Method: 通过跨测试框架分析结果，按真实语音域和伪造发布年份分组性能，识别检测盲点模式。

Result: 发现新型合成器消除了传统检测器依赖的遗留伪影，对话语音域（电话会议、访谈、社交媒体）始终最难保护。

Conclusion: 检测器不应单独用于高风险决策，应作为包含来源验证、身份凭证和政策保障的分层防御体系中的辅助信号。

Abstract: Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style
conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices,
sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a
``coverage debt" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with
existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be
collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case
performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate
the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent
cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof
release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy
artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains
(teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to
secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for
high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within
layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy
safeguards.

Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

Abstract: Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC), promises transformative advances,
including AI-enabled quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption
protocols. However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating
complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically
studied. These risks affect the trustworthiness and reliability of AI and QAI
systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews
67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data
risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five
categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user
considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities
unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work
contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for
developing future risk assessment tools.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在共享信息物理系统仿真时保护网络信息免受隐私系统识别攻击的问题，通过将差分隐私机制应用于图滤波器的输入来为图移位算子提供正式隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在共享网络化状态时间序列数据时，防止对手推断底层图结构（图移位算子）的隐私保护问题，同时保持对合法分析的有用性。

Method: 将分析师的网络状态观测建模为由差分隐私节点激励驱动的图滤波器的时间序列输出，研究防止对手识别图移位算子的假设条件，并分析差分隐私机制如何为图移位算子提供正式隐私保证。

Result: 研究表明，对输入应用差分隐私机制可以为图移位算子提供正式隐私保证，其中(ε,δ)-差分隐私界限与图滤波器的谱特性和噪声协方差相关。对于差分隐私高斯信号，滤波器和噪声协方差的谱特性共同决定隐私界限，平滑滤波器和低条件数的协方差能提供更强的隐私保护。

Conclusion: 通过将差分隐私机制应用于图滤波器的输入，可以有效保护网络图结构的隐私，同时保持数据分析的实用性，其中隐私保护强度取决于图滤波器的谱特性和噪声协方差的特性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from
privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system
simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series
outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal
excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift
operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we
study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from
identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show
that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for
the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of
the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals,
the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine
the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance
yielding greater privacy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论分析框架来研究选择性加密作为对抗模型反转攻击的防御机制，并通过实证研究量化了影响防御效果的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中共享模型梯度存在被模型反转攻击（特别是DLG）泄露隐私数据的风险。虽然同态加密可以保护梯度隐私，但完全加密所有梯度计算开销大。现有的选择性加密方法缺乏理论分析，主要依赖经验评估。

Method: 提出了选择性加密的理论分析框架，并进行了全面的实证研究，识别和量化了模型复杂度、加密比例和暴露梯度等关键因素对防御效果的影响。

Result: 理论框架阐明了梯度选择与隐私保护之间的关系，实验评估展示了这些因素如何影响防御机制对模型反转攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献推进了对选择性加密机制的理解，并为设计高效、可扩展、保护隐私的联邦学习系统提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy by keeping raw data locally stored on client devices, preventing
access from other clients or the central server. However, recent studies reveal
that sharing model gradients creates vulnerability to Model Inversion Attacks,
particularly Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG), which reconstructs private
training data from shared gradients. While Homomorphic Encryption has been
proposed as a promising defense mechanism to protect gradient privacy, fully
encrypting all model gradients incurs high computational overhead. Selective
encryption approaches aim to balance privacy protection with computational
efficiency by encrypting only specific gradient components. However, the
existing literature largely overlooks a theoretical exploration of the spectral
behavior of encrypted versus unencrypted parameters, relying instead primarily
on empirical evaluations. To address this gap, this paper presents a framework
for theoretical analysis of the underlying principles of selective encryption
as a defense against model inversion attacks. We then provide a comprehensive
empirical study that identifies and quantifies the critical factors, such as
model complexity, encryption ratios, and exposed gradients, that influence
defense effectiveness. Our theoretical framework clarifies the relationship
between gradient selection and privacy preservation, while our experimental
evaluation demonstrates how these factors shape the robustness of defenses
against model inversion attacks. Collectively, these contributions advance the
understanding of selective encryption mechanisms and offer principled guidance
for designing efficient, scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning
systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了字符级深度学习模型在钓鱼检测中的有效性，评估了CharCNN、CharGRU和CharBiLSTM三种架构在标准训练、对抗攻击和对抗训练三种场景下的表现。CharGRU在所有场景中表现最佳，对抗训练显著提升了模型鲁棒性，并采用Grad-CAM技术实现模型决策可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前钓鱼攻击检测方法缺乏可解释性和对新攻击的鲁棒性，需要开发既能提供鲁棒性又能解释决策的检测方法。

Method: 使用字符级深度学习模型（CharCNN、CharGRU、CharBiLSTM），在多源数据集上评估三种场景：标准训练测试、对抗攻击下的测试、对抗训练测试，并采用Grad-CAM技术进行决策可视化。

Result: 在计算资源受限环境下，CharGRU在所有测试场景中表现最佳；所有模型对对抗攻击都有脆弱性，但对抗训练显著提升了鲁棒性；成功实现了字符级输入的决策可视化。

Conclusion: 字符级深度学习模型在钓鱼检测中具有潜力，CharGRU是最佳选择，对抗训练能有效提升模型鲁棒性，Grad-CAM技术为模型决策提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种混合移动货币认证框架，结合USSD多因素认证和加密绑定的JWT会话管理，在撒哈拉以南非洲地区显著提升了e-Government服务的认证速度、成功率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 撒哈拉以南非洲地区移动货币服务快速普及但互联网渗透率低，现有移动货币认证方法存在SIM交换攻击风险、会话保护薄弱和高峰期可扩展性差等关键限制。

Method: 设计了三因素认证模型：SIM验证、PIN输入和会话令牌绑定，结合USSD多因素认证和加密JWT会话管理，专门针对资源受限环境。

Result: 相比基于OAuth的单点登录方法，认证时间快45%（8秒 vs 12-15秒），网络条件差时成功率提高15%（95% vs 80%），对钓鱼和暴力攻击的抵抗力增强，漏洞暴露显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为SSA及类似约束地区推进了安全的数字包容，提供了离线可访问性和安全会话连续性，解决了SIM交换和社会工程等威胁，并展示了数千用户的可扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Mobile Money Services (MMS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
offers a viable path to improve e-Government service accessibility in the face
of persistent low internet penetration. However, existing Mobile Money
Authentication (MMA) methods face critical limitations, including
susceptibility to SIM swapping, weak session protection, and poor scalability
during peak demand. This study introduces a hybrid MMA framework that combines
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based multi-factor
authentication with secure session management via cryptographically bound JSON
Web Tokens (JWT). Unlike traditional MMA systems that rely solely on SIM-PIN
verification or smartphone-dependent biometrics, our design implements a
three-factor authentication model; SIM verification, PIN entry, and session
token binding, tailored for resource-constrained environments. Simulations and
comparative analysis against OAuth-based Single Sign-On (SSO) methods reveal a
45% faster authentication time (8 seconds vs. 12 to 15 seconds), 15% higher
success under poor network conditions (95% vs. 80%), and increased resistance
to phishing and brute-force attacks. Penetration testing and threat modeling
further demonstrate a substantial reduction in vulnerability exposure compared
to conventional approaches. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) a
hybrid authentication protocol that ensures offline accessibility and secure
session continuity; (2) a tailored security framework addressing threats like
SIM swapping and social engineering in SSA; and (3) demonstrated scalability
for thousands of users with reduced infrastructure overhead. The proposed
approach advances secure digital inclusion in SSA and other regions with
similar constraints.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个生产级的LLM防御系统，借鉴恶意软件检测和威胁情报实践，通过集成威胁情报、数据平台和发布平台三个组件，提供分层保护并支持持续模型改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛部署，其自主性和权限扩展使其成为恶意攻击的目标，现有方法无法防御零日攻击，需要类似恶意软件防护的风险最小化策略。

Method: 构建包含三个组件的平台：威胁情报系统将新兴威胁转化为保护措施；数据平台聚合和丰富信息，提供可观测性和监控；发布平台实现安全快速的检测更新。

Result: 系统能够提供针对不断演变的LLM威胁的分层保护，同时生成训练数据用于持续模型改进，并在不中断生产的情况下部署更新。

Conclusion: 该生产级防御系统通过集成威胁情报、数据管理和安全发布机制，为LLM提供了持续适应威胁环境的端到端保护方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管FHE系统在实际平台中部署越来越多，但其可靠性方面，特别是对故障的响应机制，一直被忽视。本文旨在更好地理解FHE计算在内存故障存在时的行为。

Method: 研究FHE计算在内存故障下的行为，包括单个操作层面和应用层面的表现，针对不同的FHE方案进行分析。

Conclusion: FHE系统的可靠性问题需要重视，传统和FHE特定的故障缓解技术对于确保FHE计算的安全性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in
cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking
privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real
platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond
to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of
how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of
individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different
FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific
fault mitigation techniques are.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了神经网络中加密后门在攻击和防御两个方向上的高效应用，包括可证明鲁棒的神经网络水印方案、用户认证协议和IP追踪协议，同时实现了基于后门的强大隐形攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络中加密后门的双重用途：既可作为强大的隐形攻击手段，又可作为防御工具用于水印、认证和IP保护等应用。

Method: 借鉴Goldwasser等人的理论思想，在先进神经网络架构上实现加密后门，包括水印方案、认证协议和IP追踪协议，并使用后量子密码原语。

Result: 所有协议实现都具有可证明的鲁棒性，水印、认证和IP追踪协议能抵抗黑盒访问的对手，而后门攻击在标准假设下无法预防。实证结果验证了理论主张。

Conclusion: 加密后门在神经网络中具有双重应用价值，既可用于攻击也可用于防御，为量子时代的机器学习应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN)
can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well
as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted
cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN.
Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN
watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication;
and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual
property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from
Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these
instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The
protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary
with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial
attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the
theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et.
al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all
these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with
empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can
utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors,
laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP工具已成为LLM智能体与环境交互的标准协议，但其集成带来了工具投毒攻击风险。现有研究多停留在概念验证阶段，缺乏自动化和系统化的红队测试方法。

Method: 提出AutoMalTool框架，自动生成恶意MCP工具来测试LLM智能体的安全性。

Result: 评估显示AutoMalTool能有效生成恶意MCP工具，能够操纵主流LLM智能体的行为并规避当前检测机制。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM智能体在MCP工具投毒攻击下的新安全风险，表明现有安全防护措施存在不足。

Abstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ExpIDS是一个基于深度学习的网络入侵检测系统，通过提高决策树解释的保真度来解决机器学习模型在网络安全中的可解释性问题，同时能够适应网络流量分布的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于机器学习的网络入侵检测系统具有诸多优势，但由于其决策过程不透明，网络安全专家在实际生产环境中部署这些模型时存在很大顾虑。

Method: 设计了一个深度学习网络入侵检测系统ExpIDS，使其具有高决策树解释保真度，即决策树解释的预测应尽可能接近ExpIDS的预测，同时能够适应网络流量分布的变化。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，ExpIDS在常见攻击检测中实现了更高的决策树解释保真度，并且恶意流量检测性能与最先进的NIDS相当，能够适应不同程度的实际漂移。

Conclusion: ExpIDS成功解决了机器学习模型在网络入侵检测中的可解释性问题，同时保持了良好的检测性能和对流量变化的适应性。

Abstract: Despite all the advantages associated with Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDSs) that utilize machine learning (ML) models, there is a
significant reluctance among cyber security experts to implement these models
in real-world production settings. This is primarily because of their opaque
nature, meaning it is unclear how and why the models make their decisions. In
this work, we design a deep learning-based NIDS, ExpIDS to have high decision
tree explanation fidelity, i.e., the predictions of decision tree explanation
corresponding to ExpIDS should be as close to ExpIDS's predictions as possible.
ExpIDS can also adapt to changes in network traffic distribution (drift). With
the help of extensive experiments, we verify that ExpIDS achieves higher
decision tree explanation fidelity and a malicious traffic detection
performance comparable to state-of-the-art NIDSs for common attacks with
varying levels of real-world drift.

Motivation: 现有可撤销属性基加密方案在效率、安全性、动态可扩展性等方面难以达到最优平衡，限制了其在实际物联网环境中的应用。

Method: 设计了一种快速RABE方案，支持授权用户撤销，将计算密集的撤销过程转移到云端，确保数据完整性和正确性，并在定义的安全模型中证明其自适应安全性。

Result: 实验结果表明，在相同访问策略下，本方案的计算消耗比现有方案减少7-9倍，性能优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方案在物联网环境中实现了高效、安全的可撤销属性基加密，为云存储和外包数据环境提供了实用的访问控制和数据共享解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and secure revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) is vital for
ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control and data sharing in cloud
storage and outsourced data environments within the Internet of Things (IoT).
However, current RABE schemes often struggle to achieve an optimal balance
between efficiency, security, dynamic scalability, and other important
features, which hampers their practical application. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a fast RABE scheme with data integrity for IoT that
achieves adaptive security with multiple challenge ciphertexts. Our scheme
supports the revocation of authorized users and transfers the computationally
heavy revocation processes to the cloud, thereby easing the computational
burden on IoT devices. Moreover, it consistently guarantees the integrity and
correctness of data. We have demonstrated its adaptive security within the
defined security model with multiple challenge ciphertexts and optimized its
performance. Experimental results indicate that our scheme provides better
performance than existing solutions. Under the same access policy, our scheme
reduces computational consumption by 7 to 9 times compared to previous schemes.

TL;DR: PROFUZZ是一个新颖的硬件定向模糊测试框架，结合了模糊测试和自动测试模式生成(ATPG)，解决了现有方法在硬件描述语言支持、可扩展性和抽象不匹配方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬件定向模糊测试方法如DirectFuzz存在主要缺陷：仅支持有限的硬件描述语言、无法扩展到大型电路、存在抽象不匹配问题，需要更有效的定向测试生成方法。

Method: PROFUZZ采用定向灰盒模糊测试(DGF)方法，将模糊测试与ATPG相结合，利用ATPG的结构分析能力生成精确的输入种子，更有效地针对特定设计区域。

Result: 实验表明，PROFUZZ在处理多个目标站点时比DirectFuzz扩展性好30倍，覆盖率提高11.66%，运行速度快2.76倍。

Conclusion: PROFUZZ在复杂硬件系统中展现出卓越的可扩展性和有效性，为硬件定向模糊测试提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware Fuzzing emerged as one of the crucial techniques for finding
security flaws in modern hardware designs by testing a wide range of input
scenarios. One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that
maximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF)
methods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on
specific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF)
techniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but
it has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description
languages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with
abstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel
framework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with
Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By
leveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate
precise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while
maintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales
30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves
coverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and
effectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems.

Motivation: 传统ISAC系统面临窃听威胁，需要在不显著改变硬件基础设施的前提下增强系统安全性。

Result: 仿真结果验证了SS-ISAC框架在感知通信性能和防窃听方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SS-ISAC框架提供了一种灵活的安全增强方案，能够有效防止窃听威胁同时保持系统性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, continuous interaction among a
large number of devices generates complex and dynamic network traffic, which
poses significant challenges to rule-based detection approaches. Machine
learning (ML)-based traffic detection technology, capable of identifying
anomalous patterns and potential threats within this traffic, serves as a
critical component in ensuring network security. This study first identifies a
significant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g.,
CICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to
high sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing
traffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of
efficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of
network traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature
extraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor
of context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving
the generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training
framework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a
contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic
representations of traffic. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on
the real-world Mawi data set to validate the proposed method in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Comparative experiments
against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models demonstrate the superior
performance of our approach. Furthermore, we confirm its applicability and
deployability in real-time scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出并分析了一个广义映射χ_{n,m}，解决了χ_n只能在奇数维向量空间上双射的限制。通过进一步推广到θ_{m,k}，证明了这些映射生成一个与F_2[z]/(z^{⌊n/m⌋+1})单位群同构的阿贝尔群，从而构造了在任意正整数n的F_2^n上的置换类及其逆映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决χ_n映射只能在奇数维向量空间上双射的限制，扩展其在轻量级密码学中的应用范围。

Method: 引入广义映射χ_{n,m}和θ_{m,k}，通过代数结构分析证明这些映射生成阿贝尔群，并构造置换类及其逆映射。

Result: 成功构造了在任意正整数n的F_2^n上的置换类，分析了其代数性质，提供了小n和m值时χ_{n,m}迭代的密码学性质数据库，并证明了Belkheyar等人的猜想1。

Conclusion: 研究结果推广了χ_n映射，为轻量级密码学提供了χ_n和χχ_n的替代方案。

Abstract: The mapping $\chi_n$ from $\F_{2}^{n}$ to itself defined by $y=\chi_n(x)$
with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+2}(1+x_{i+1})$, where the indices are computed modulo $n$,
has been widely studied for its applications in lightweight cryptography.
However, $\chi_n $ is bijective on $\F_2^n$ only when $n$ is odd, restricting
its use to odd-dimensional vector spaces over $\F_2$. To address this
limitation, we introduce and analyze the generalized mapping $\chi_{n, m}$
defined by $y=\chi_{n,m}(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+m} (x_{i+m-1}+1)(x_{i+m-2}+1)
\cdots (x_{i+1}+1)$, where $m$ is a fixed integer with $m\nmid n$. To
investigate such mappings, we further generalize $\chi_{n,m}$ to $\theta_{m,
k}$, where $\theta_{m, k}$ is given by $y_i=x_{i+mk} \prod_{\substack{j=1,\,\,
m \nmid j}}^{mk-1} \left(x_{i+j}+1\right), \,\,{\rm for }\,\, i\in
\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We prove that these mappings generate an abelian group
isomorphic to the group of units in $\F_2[z]/(z^{\lfloor n/m\rfloor +1})$. This
structural insight enables us to construct a broad class of permutations over
$\F_2^n$ for any positive integer $n$, along with their inverses. We rigorously
analyze algebraic properties of these mappings, including their iterations,
fixed points, and cycle structures. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive
database of the cryptographic properties for iterates of $\chi_{n,m}$ for small
values of $n$ and $m$. Finally, we conduct a comparative security and
implementation cost analysis among $\chi_{n,m}$, $\chi_n$, $\chi\chi_n$
(EUROCRYPT 2025 \cite{belkheyar2025chi}) and their variants, and prove
Conjecture~1 proposed in~\cite{belkheyar2025chi} as a by-product of our study.
Our results lead to generalizations of $\chi_n$, providing alternatives to
$\chi_n$ and $\chi\chi_n$.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应鲁棒性半径作为水印鲁棒性的正式度量，并开发了RLCracker强化学习攻击方法，能够在仅使用少量水印样本的情况下有效移除多种水印方案，揭示了当前LLM水印技术的严重脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM水印技术的评估不够对抗性，掩盖了关键漏洞并高估了安全性。作者认为需要更严格的评估方法来揭示水印技术的真实脆弱性。

Method: 提出自适应鲁棒性半径理论框架，并开发RLCracker——基于强化学习的自适应攻击方法，仅需少量水印样本且无需访问检测器，通过优化攻击上下文和模型参数来移除水印。

Result: RLCracker使用3B模型在仅训练100个短样本后，对1500个token的Unigram水印文本实现了98.5%的移除成功率，平均P-SP得分0.92，远超GPT-4o的6.75%成功率，并在10种水印方案和5种模型规模上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 自适应攻击对当前水印防御构成根本性威胁，现有水印技术在对抗性攻击下高度脆弱，需要重新评估和改进水印方案的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) watermarking has shown promise in detecting
AI-generated content and mitigating misuse, with prior work claiming robustness
against paraphrasing and text editing. In this paper, we argue that existing
evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical
vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce
adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark
resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing
the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius,
making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this
insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive
attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker
requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector.
Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal
success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts
after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds
6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking
schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and
pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络威胁情报的有效性依赖于高质量数据集，而Telegram作为新兴的CTI来源，提供了及时多样的威胁相关信息，但需要系统化的方法来收集和筛选这些内容。

Method: 开发了一个端到端自动化管道，包括识别相关Telegram频道、抓取145,349条消息，并使用基于BERT的分类器以96.64%的准确率筛选威胁情报消息。

Result: 从12个精选频道中构建了包含86,509个恶意指标（域名、IP、URL、哈希值和CVE）的数据集，准确率达到96.64%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅产生了大规模高保真度的CTI数据集，还为未来网络威胁检测的研究和操作应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

<details>

Motivation: 传统钓鱼检测方法仅孤立分析邮件内容或URL，无法全面应对日益复杂的钓鱼攻击，需要一种综合分析方法来同时处理语义和结构漏洞。

Method: 采用双路径框架：1) 使用微调的Transformer架构（如DistilBERT）进行语义分析；2) 使用字符级TF-IDF向量化结合传统分类器（如随机森林）进行链接结构分析。

Conclusion: 双路径方法具有高效性、实用性和可扩展性，为应对当代钓鱼威胁提供了准确且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

Motivation: 现有语义级水印方法缺乏强理论鲁棒性保证，且基于拒绝采样的生成方式会导致与无水印输出的显著分布失真。

Method: 提出代理函数理论框架，通过动态采样估计句子代理函数中位数，并施加多通道约束来增强水印证据。

Result: 实验结果表明PMark在文本质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有语义级水印基线方法。

Conclusion: PMark为检测机器生成文本提供了更有效的范式，具有无失真特性和更强的抗攻击能力。

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,

### [48] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于监控AI智能体行为的时间表达式语言，能够系统性地检测基于LLM的智能体系统中的错误，重点关注智能体动作序列而非文本输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性而显得脆弱，需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出来验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，监控智能体工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹，通过时间表达式语言捕获正确的行为模式。

Result: 在由大型模型驱动的三智能体系统中，所有时间断言都得到满足；但当两个智能体使用较小模型时，执行违反了行为断言，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。

Conclusion: 该方法为监控AI智能体可靠性提供了基础，特别适用于关键应用中的生产智能体系统行为回归检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有验证器方法在测试时均匀增加计算量，不考虑不同样本和生成步骤的复杂度差异，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: 使用验证器模型的接受标准，在每个生成步骤动态决定是否重采样、回溯、重启或停止，基于局部难度调整每步计算量。

Result: 实验结果显示LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算量权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS方法通过局部自适应测试时扩展，有效解决了验证器方法中计算资源分配不均的问题，提升了效率。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE是一个基于多级反思合成的自学习LLM智能体框架，通过训练回顾性语言模型在三个层次进行反思：微观的单轨迹学习、中观的同任务内学习和宏观的跨任务学习，显著提升了复杂任务中的反思能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在生成有意义的反思方面面临挑战，主要由于错误分析不足和过度依赖少数成功轨迹，特别是在复杂任务中。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，通过多级反思合成训练回顾性语言模型：1）单轨迹学习（微观）进行详细错误修正；2）同任务内学习（中观）构建错误分类法；3）跨任务学习（宏观）提取可迁移见解。还扩展到交互设置，通过基于前瞻的反思机制实现主动反思。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个具有挑战性的基准测试中，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习对于构建自改进的LLM智能体至关重要。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat

framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Conclusion: 结合基于人群的结构化评分与模块化工具增强推理，实现透明、可扩展的放疗计划评估，未来需临床验证和改进检索模型

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多代理移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习来解决现有移动GUI代理在真实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理方面存在不足，端到端方法在长尾应用上表现不佳，且缺乏用户交互的代理会损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：全局任务规划器将用户任务分解为跨应用子任务；应用级执行器基于长短期记忆细化子任务为步骤和动作；自学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Result: 使用GPT-4o骨干的Fairy在RealMobile-Eval基准测试中，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%，优于之前的SoTA方法。

Conclusion: Fairy通过其交互和自我学习能力，在移动GUI代理任务中表现出显著的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归(AR)和非自回归(NAR)语言模型的新框架，利用NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，然后指导AR模型产生精确最终答案，在保持质量的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在推理密集型任务中生成连贯输出但推理速度慢，而非自回归模型虽然速度快但输出质量较低，需要一种能兼顾两者优势的方法。

Method: 采用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后用这些轨迹指导AR模型生成精确的最终答案，形成AR-NAR混合推理框架。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线实现了26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中能够有效平衡输出质量和推理效率，为复杂推理问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Motivation: 机器人需要在复杂环境中有效存储观测作为记忆，并利用这些记忆回答人类关于空间位置的查询，这是一个关键但研究不足的挑战。现有工作很少解决高效记忆检索和整合的原则性机制。

Method: Meta-Memory是一个LLM驱动的智能体，构建环境的高密度记忆表示。其核心创新在于能够通过语义和空间模态的联合推理来检索和整合相关记忆。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory通过联合语义和空间推理，为机器人提供了强大准确的空间推理能力，在复杂环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个从粗到细的推理增强框架，通过两阶段方法提升LLM在日志分析任务中的专家级推理能力，在四个不同任务上实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM难以构建与专家认知一致的结构化推理工作流，无法提供精确的推理步骤细节，这限制了其在日志分析中的应用。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1)粗粒度增强专家思维，从故障排除流程图构建高层专家思维；2)细粒度增强具体步骤，通过任务特定逐步解决方案微调LLM，并使用偏好学习从错误中校准推理细节。

Result: 在四个不同的日志分析任务中，LogReasoner显著优于现有LLM，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，使其能够像专家一样进行推理。

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，通过反事实训练提升了模型的推理质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中只能部分利用多组学特征、拓扑背景和文本知识，限制了机制可解释性。需要整合定量多组学信号、拓扑结构和文献规模文本，通过子图推理连接数值证据、拓扑知识和语言背景。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以强化学习方式逐步生成疾病相关子图，由预训练GNN迭代评估，实现过程级监督而无需显式中间推理标注。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学特征和生物医学图知识，支持GNN预训练和长上下文文本-数值图推理，为可解释靶点和通路发现提供可扩展框架。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展且生物学基础扎实的框架，通过强化引导的子图推理实现精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术难以理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等语言特征。

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级详细见解，并通过检索增强的对话问答支持交互式评论探索。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中表现优异，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Motivation: 多步逆合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本上存在限制，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将LLM生成的完整合成路径原子映射到AND-OR树组件，采用数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航。

Result: AOT*在多个合成基准测试中达到SOTA性能，相比现有LLM方法使用3-5倍更少的迭代次数就能达到竞争性的解决率，对复杂分子目标的效率优势更加明显。

Conclusion: AOT*通过整合LLM与系统化树搜索，有效解决了逆合成规划的计算挑战，显著提升了搜索效率和性能。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架和CORE评估套件能够对代理行为进行原则性评估，识别传统方法无法发现的性能差异。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

Motivation: 当前的长文本基准通常使用非科学文本、关注简单的信息检索任务或采用人工构建的上下文，存在局限性。SciTrek旨在解决这些问题，评估模型在真实科学文章中的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据（标题、作者、参考文献）数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案。SQL操作为细粒度错误分析提供可验证的推理步骤，构建过程可扩展到100万token的上下文。

Result: 在多种开源和专有LLM上的广泛实验表明，随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek带来了显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习只能提供有限的改进。模型在执行基本数值运算和准确定位长文本中特定信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek是一个具有挑战性的长文本推理基准，揭示了当前LLM在复杂科学推理任务中的局限性，特别是在数值运算和信息定位方面的不足。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个三代理神经符号框架，通过顺序决策过程在知识图谱上构建上下文，在保证准确性的同时控制延迟和成本，实现可预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱问答系统在静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法中存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用三代理神经符号框架：子图架构师、路径导航器和上下文策展人，使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG实现了+39.3 EM@1，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、保留来源的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，有效平衡了准确性、延迟和成本之间的权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了评估AI系统创造性能力的理论框架，发现LLMs在科学创意生成中存在新颖性与实用性的权衡，且存在最优模型深度和宽度，对当前LLMs的长期创造潜力提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架无法评估AI系统在创造性任务（如科学创意生成）中的表现，需要建立针对开放式创造能力的评估方法。

Method: 提出评估创意新颖性和实用性的理论框架和算法任务，分析LLMs的规模扩展行为、模型结构对创造力的影响，以及新颖性-实用性的权衡关系。

Result: 发现LLMs在固定计算预算下存在最优模型深度和宽度；存在创意生成与可行性保障之间的差距；新颖性与实用性之间存在持续的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLMs在长期创造潜力上存在局限，需要新的方法来理解和改进AI模型的创造力，这标志着泛化能力的新前沿。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态由模型的认知过程特别是显式推理能力决定，揭示了说服二元性：LRMs在推理过程中更抗说服，但分享思考内容能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的快速发展，需要深入理解LLMs和LRMs协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战当前关于模型规模决定说服效能的主流假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究LRMs的推理过程对说服抗性和说服能力的影响，并考虑更复杂的传播说服情境。

Result: 发现LRMs在推理过程中表现出更强的说服抗性，能更稳健地保持初始信念；而分享推理过程能显著增强其说服他人的能力；在多跳说服网络中揭示了影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Conclusion: 研究提供了系统证据，将模型的内部处理架构与其外部说服行为联系起来，为先进模型的易感性提供了新颖解释，对MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在解决真实网页上的多轮、长轨迹任务时，仍然存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要更智能的浏览器使用代理。

Method: 采用侦察-行动行为范式，包含侦察团队和行动团队。侦察团队通过对比错误轨迹与成功轨迹推断补救措施，并将其抽象为通用工具；行动团队利用这些工具重新推理执行过程，形成数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道。

Conclusion: Recon-Act框架通过侦察-行动范式和通用工具的使用，有效解决了多轮网页任务中的动作序列混乱和试错问题，为智能浏览器代理的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: TrustJudge是一个概率框架，解决了LLM作为评估器时存在的评分比较不一致性和成对传递性不一致性问题，通过分布敏感评分和似然感知聚合来提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估器存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递性不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息损失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵以进行更精确的评分；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低了8.43%（从23.32%降至14.89%），成对传递性不一致性降低了10.82%（从15.22%降至4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge提供了对LLM作为评估器范式下评估框架不一致性的首次系统分析，为可靠的自动评估提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可信的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

<details>

Motivation: 当前方法通常不加区分地使用链式思维数据，未能有效识别哪些数据类型最能增强模型推理能力，因此需要更智能的数据选择策略。

Method: 提出从CoT序列中抽象出原子推理模式，构建富含价值推理模式的核心参考集，并开发基于推理模式链和token熵的双粒度算法来高效选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的高价值CoT数据，就能让850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上提升9.58%，并将下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地训练模型掌握推理能力，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分析框架，从推理路径的角度研究RL和SFT训练如何塑造大语言模型的推理能力，发现RL压缩错误轨迹、集中推理功能，而SFT扩展正确轨迹、均化推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型通常通过强化学习（RL）和监督微调（SFT）来提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体影响推理过程仍不清楚，需要超越准确率层面的深入分析。

Method: 提出两层次分析框架：轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应推理步骤）。在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，通过聚类和网络分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度数和介数中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，SFT使其减少到约三分之一；RL将推理功能集中在少数步骤，SFT使其均化到更多步骤。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练成功的原因在于两者的互补作用，研究为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务或多轮对话，忽视了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性，且当前强化学习方法难以在训练中考虑他人策略。

Method: 定义包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，提出ToMPO算法优化对其他个体策略和游戏态势趋势的感知。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果上提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法能有效增强模型在战略决策方面的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以实现动作理解和执行任务之间的协同提升，验证了镜像神经元机制在机器学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非专家混合式模块化处理稀有词汇，为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了容量感知表示和结构化的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language

reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在疾病预测中难以平衡准确性和可解释性，要么准确但解释不清，要么解释流畅但统计不支持。需要开发能建立深度数据理解的模型。

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），使用预测准确性驱动更深理解。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线方法，RCA达到最先进的准确性和鲁棒性，相对改进高达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据的平衡解释。

Conclusion: RCA通过深度数据理解同时实现了高预测准确性和高质量解释，具有创建真正可信临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Result: 提供了个性化视频数据集收集的新基准，通过用户研究验证了代理在各种真实场景中的使用效果，实验证明了代理在定制化视频数据集收集方面的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: VC-Agent通过交互式方法和智能过滤策略，成功解决了定制化视频数据集收集的挑战，为视频数据收集提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

### [83] [SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310)
*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个评估嵌入模型和相似性度量的基准测试，涵盖5个语义理解维度，在30+数据集上测试发现现有方法存在显著性能差距，没有单一方法在所有维度都表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准测试上表现强劲，需要更挑战性的评估框架来深入探测语义理解的各个方面。

Method: 引入SAGE基准，通过对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务评估嵌入模型和相似性度量，涵盖5个类别：人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能和检索鲁棒性。

Result: 评估9个嵌入模型和经典度量发现显著性能差距：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳(0.682)，但在信息敏感性任务上被Jaccard相似性显著超越(0.905 vs 0.794)；text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高(0.483)但鲁棒性最差(0.011)。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
