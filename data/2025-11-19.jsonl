The deep learning models adopted in these studies demand significant computational resources for training and inference acceleration. This introduces high costs and undermines the cost-reduction goal of predictive mutation testing. (2) Constrained applicability. Although modern mutation testing tools generate mutants both inside and outside methods, current fine-grained predictive mutation testing approaches handle only inside-method mutants. As a result, they cannot predict outside-method mutants, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose WITNESS, a new fine-grained predictive mutation testing approach. WITNESS adopts a twofold design: (1) With collected features from both inside-method and outside-method mutants, WITNESS is suitable for all generated mutants. (2) Instead of using computationally expensive deep learning, WITNESS employs lightweight classical machine learning models for training and prediction. This makes it more cost-effective and enabling straightforward explanations of the decision-making processes behind the adopted models. Evaluations on Defects4J projects show that WITNESS consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across different scenarios. Additionally, WITNESS significantly enhances the efficiency of kill matrix prediction. Post-hoc analysis reveals that features incorporating information from before and after the mutation are the most important among those used in WITNESS. Test case prioritization based on the predicted kill matrix shows that WITNESS delivers results much closer to those obtained by using the actual kill matrix, outperforming baseline approaches."}

Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance."}

However, the widespread adoption of static analysis tools is hindered by their high false alarm rates. Previous studies have introduced the concept of actionable warnings and built a machine-learning method to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. However, according to our empirical observation, the current assumption used for actionable warning(s) collection is rather shaky and inaccurate, leading to a large number of invalid actionable warnings. To address this problem, in this study, we build the first large actionable warning dataset by mining 68,274 reversions from Top-500 GitHub C repositories, we then take one step further by assigning each actionable warning a weak label regarding its likelihood of being a real bug. Following that, we propose a two-stage framework called ACWRecommender to automatically recommend the actionable warnings with high probability to be real bugs (AWHB). Our approach warms up the pre-trained model UniXcoder by identifying actionable warnings task (coarse-grained detection stage) and rerank AWHB to the top by weakly supervised learning (fine-grained reranking stage). Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several baselines by a large margin in terms of nDCG and MRR for AWHB recommendation. Moreover, we ran our tool on 6 randomly selected projects and manually checked the top-ranked warnings from 2,197 reported warnings, we reported top-10 recommended warnings to developers, 27 of them were already confirmed by developers as real bugs. Developers can quickly find real bugs among the massive amount of reported warnings, which verifies the practical usage of our tool."}

Moreover, the digitalised services provided by governmental organisations and companies are governed by an increasing amount of laws and regulations, requiring highly adaptable compliance practices. A potential solution is to automate compliance using software. However, automating compliance is difficult for various reasons. Legal practices involve subjective processes such as interpretation and qualification. New laws and regulations come into effect regularly and laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, are subjected to constant revision. In addition, computational reasoning with laws requires a cross-disciplinary process involving both legal and software expertise.\n  This paper reflects on the domain-specific software language eFLINT developed to experiment with novel solutions. The language combines declarative and procedural elements to reason about situations and scenarios respectively, explicates and formalises connections between legal concepts and computational concepts, and is designed to automate compliance checks both before, during and after a software system runs. The various goals and applications areas for the language give rise to (conflicting) requirements. This paper reflects on the current design of the language by recalling various applications, the requirements they imposed, and subsequent design decisions. As such, this paper reports on results and insights of an investigation that can benefit language developers within the field of automated compliance."}

We systematically evaluated safety guardrails across six frontier LLMs spanning four attack categories, revealing critical failures where several models exhibited near-complete susceptibility to certain attack vectors. In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics. While some providers report voluntary counter-abuse efforts, we argue these remain insufficient."}

A specialized corpus of negative news headlines was created using tailored prompts to capture diverse negative sentiments across various societal domains. The synthetic headlines were validated by expert review and further analyzed in embedding space to assess their alignment with real-world negative news in terms of content, tone, length, and style.

The synthetic dataset was benchmarked against two sets of real news headlines using evaluations including the Comparative Perplexity Test, Comparative Readability Test, Comparative POS Profiling, BERTScore, and Comparative Semantic Similarity.

Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14. Apart from that, it is also the only approach to consistently form true consensus on tasks with multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions."}

Although many programming languages and frameworks exist, engineers still lack sufficient empirical evidence to guide the choice of tools for advanced industrial applications.

These technologies reflect a progression from procedural and object-oriented programming to agent-based frameworks capable of symbolic and fuzzy reasoning.\n  Rather than relying on broad concepts such as paradigms or orientations, the study adopts a developer-centred approach grounded in measurable outcomes. The structured comparison examines how rising abstraction levels and reasoning capabilities affect both development effort and runtime behaviour. By analysing these dimensions, the study highlights concrete trade-offs between engineering workload and execution efficiency.\n  The findings show how abstraction and reasoning mechanisms shape system performance and developer productivity, offering practical insight for designing intelligent, agent-based solutions that must operate under real-time constraints and complex decision-making requirements.

Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.\n  This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528."}

Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.\n  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.\n  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\\% of the time while missing only 8.3\\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself."}

CITADEL further integrates supervised contrastive loss to improve boundary sample discrimination and combines it with a multi-criteria active learning strategy based on prediction confidence, $L_p$-norm distance, and boundary uncertainty, enabling effective adaptation under limited labeling budgets.

When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs."}

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored side channel in RAG systems: the generation budget, which controls the maximum number of tokens allowed in a generated response. Varying this budget reveals observable behavioral patterns between member and non-member queries, as members gain quality more rapidly with larger budgets. Building on this insight, we propose BudgetLeak, a novel membership inference attack that probes responses under different budgets and analyzes metric evolution via sequence modeling or clustering.

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

Existing KD backdoor methods are typically complex and computationally intensive: they employ surrogate student models and simulated distillation to guarantee transferability, and they construct triggers in a way similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which being not stealthy in magnitude, inherently exhibit strong adversarial behavior. This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy \"weak\" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, model architectures, and KD methods show that BackWeak is efficient, simpler, and often more stealthy than previous elaborate approaches. This work calls on researchers studying KD backdoor attacks to pay particular attention to the trigger's stealthiness and its potential adversarial characteristics."}

The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer.

Drawing from a literature review, we identified a set of guidelines for designing software for vulnerable communities and translated these into sixty-two functional and non-functional requirements.

A total of 654 articles within the time span of 2017 to 2023 have been considered. Experimental evaluation of the study reveals that 69% of published articles are from Asian countries. The China is on top (TP:312), followed by India (TP-114). The study mainly identifies seven thematic clusters: steganographic image data hiding, deep image steganalysis, neural watermark robustness, linguistic steganography models, speech steganalysis algorithms, covert communication networks, and video steganography techniques. The proposed study also assesses the scope of AI-steganography under the purview of sustainable development goals (SDGs) to present the interdisciplinary reciprocity between them. It has been observed that only 18 of the 654 articles are aligned with one of the SDGs, which shows that limited studies conducted in alignment with SDG goals. SDG9 which is Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure is leading among 18 SDGs mapped articles.

Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs."}

In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 2,303 agent context files from 1,925 repositories to characterize their structure, maintenance, and content. We find that these files are not static documentation but complex, difficult-to-read artifacts that evolve like configuration code, maintained through frequent, small additions. Our content analysis of 16 instruction types shows that developers prioritize functional context, such as build and run commands (62.3%), implementation details (69.9%), and architecture (67.7%).

Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat.

Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions."}

Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks."}

However, their direct application to alternative versions often fails due to breaking changes introduced during evolution. These failures stem from both changes in triggering conditions (e.g., API refactorings) and broken dynamic environments (e.g., build or runtime errors), which are challenging to interpret and adapt manually. Existing techniques primarily focus on code-level trace alignment through fuzzing, which is both time-consuming and insufficient for handling environment-level failures. Moreover, they often fall short when dealing with complicated triggering condition changes across versions. To overcome this, we propose Diffploit, an iterative, diff-driven exploit migration method structured around two key modules: the Context Module and the Migration Module. The Context Module dynamically constructs contexts derived from analyzing behavioral discrepancies between the target and reference versions, which capture the failure symptom and its related diff hunks. Leveraging these contexts, the Migration Module guides an LLM-based adaptation through an iterative feedback loop, balancing exploration of diff candidates and gradual refinement to resolve reproduction failures effectively. We evaluate Diffploit on a large-scale dataset containing 102 Java CVEs and 689 version-migration tasks across 79 libraries. Diffploit successfully migrates 84.2% exploits, outperforming the change-aware test repair tool TARGET by 52.0% and the rule-based tool in IDEA by 61.6%. Beyond technical effectiveness, Diffploit identifies 5 CVE reports with incorrect affected version ranges, three of which have been confirmed. It also discovers 111 unreported vulnerable versions in the GitHub Advisory Database."}

Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems."}

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse."}

In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively.

It employs large language model-driven agents as the fuzzing engine and continuously improves itself by learning and reflecting through interactions with the environment. Specifically, we first propose a new Continuous Reflection Process (CRP) for fuzzing smart contracts, which reforms the transaction sequence generation as a self-evolving process through continuous reflection on feedback from the runtime environment. Then, we present the Reactive Collaborative Chain (RCC) to orchestrate the fuzzing process into multiple sub-tasks based on the dependencies of transaction sequences. Furthermore, we design a multi-agent collaborative team, where each expert agent is guided by the RCC to jointly generate and refine transaction sequences from both global and local perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SmartFuzz's performance on real-world contracts and DApp projects.

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

Objective: This study aims to analyze these research gaps in the context of GenAI-enabled software systems. It seeks to establish a coherent perspective for a systematic analysis of responsibility gaps from a human oversight requirements standpoint, encompassing how these responsibility gaps should be conceptualized, identified, and represented throughout the RE process. Methods: The proposed design methodology is structured across three analytical layers. At the conceptualization layer, it establishes a conceptual framing that defines the key elements of responsibility across the human and system dimensions and explains how potential responsibility gaps emerge from their interactions. At the methodological layer, it introduces a deductive pipeline for identifying responsibility gaps by analyzing interactions between these dimensions and deriving corresponding oversight requirements within established RE frameworks. At the artifact layer, it formalizes the results in a Deductive Backbone Table, a reusable representation that traces the reasoning path from responsibility gaps identification to human oversight requirements derivation. Results: A user study compared the proposed methodology with a baseline goal-oriented RE across two scenarios. Evaluation across six dimensions indicated clear improvements of the proposed methodology, confirming its effectiveness in addressing three research gaps."}

RulePilot is equipped with the intermediate representation (IR), which abstracts the complexity of config rules into structured, standardized formats, allowing LLMs to focus on generation rules in a more manageable and consistent way.

Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use. By enabling automatic interpretable assessment, F2O establishes a foundation for data-driven surgical feedback and prospective clinical decision support."}

Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding."}

The core eFPE algorithm module itself is notably compact, requiring only 3.55 kB ROM and 116 B RAM. These characteristics make eFPE a distinct and highly suitable solution for applications like financial terminals, medical sensors, and industrial IoT devices where data format integrity, minimal resource footprint, and low operational latency are paramount."}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness."}

Existing service-level testing tools, especially for RESTful APIs, often employ fuzzing and/or depend on OpenAPI specifications which are not readily available in real-world enterprise codebases. Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios. In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications. SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints. SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests. Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage. Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop. We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation. Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT. Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation."}

We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions."}

A curated dataset of benign and adversarial prompts was encoded with sentence embedding and used to train both centralized and federated logistic regression models. The federated approach preserved privacy by sharing only model parameters across clients, while achieving detection performance comparable to centralized training. Results demonstrate that effective prompt injection detection is feasible without exposing raw data, making this one of the first explorations of federated security for LLMs. Although the dataset is limited in scale, the findings establish a strong proof-of-concept and highlight new directions for building secure and privacy-aware LLM systems."}

With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks."}

Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $β$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling.

In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios).

IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.\n  While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.\n  To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities."}

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.\n  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.\n  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.\n  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection."}

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution.

To address these gaps, we propose GRAPHTEXTACK, the first black-box, multi-modal{, poisoning} node injection attack for LLM-enhanced GNNs. GRAPHTEXTACK injects nodes with carefully crafted structure and semantics to degrade model performance, operating under a realistic threat model without relying on model internals or surrogate models. To navigate the combinatorial, non-differentiable search space of connectivity and feature assignments, GRAPHTEXTACK introduces a novel evolutionary optimization framework with a multi-objective fitness function that balances local prediction disruption and global graph influence. Extensive experiments on five datasets and two state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced GNN models show that GRAPHTEXTACK significantly outperforms 12 strong baselines."}

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods."}

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5.

To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability.

Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\\textit{C}ontent-preserving \\textit{L}inguistic \\textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation.

To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text.

To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528."}

We identify the root cause of this trade-off to be the standard symmetric reward design, which treats all reports equally. We prove that no symmetric-reward mechanism can overcome the trade-off.\n  We present Personal Random Rewards for Reporting (Prrr), a protocol that assigns random heterogeneous values to reports.

For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO).

However, existing fuzzers are falling short in detecting sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific attack transaction sequences with proper inputs to trigger, as they (i) prioritize code coverage over vulnerability discovery, wasting considerable effort on non-vulnerable code regions, and (ii) lack semantic understanding of stateful contracts, generating numerous invalid transaction sequences that cannot pass runtime execution.\n  In this paper, we propose SmartFuzz, a novel collaborative reflective fuzzer for smart contract vulnerability detection. It employs large language model-driven agents as the fuzzing engine and continuously improves itself by learning and reflecting through interactions with the environment. Specifically, we first propose a new Continuous Reflection Process (CRP) for fuzzing smart contracts, which reforms the transaction sequence generation as a self-evolving process through continuous reflection on feedback from the runtime environment. Then, we present the Reactive Collaborative Chain (RCC) to orchestrate the fuzzing process into multiple sub-tasks based on the dependencies of transaction sequences. Furthermore, we design a multi-agent collaborative team, where each expert agent is guided by the RCC to jointly generate and refine transaction sequences from both global and local perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SmartFuzz's performance on real-world contracts and DApp projects. The results demonstrate that SmartFuzz outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools: (i) it detects 5.8\\%-74.7\\% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes, and (ii) it reduces false negatives by up to 80\\%."}

Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines."}

To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.\n  While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.\n  To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858.

This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields.

It is based on an approach described as an \"offensive tool determination strategy,\" summarized by the acronym R.I.D.D.L.E.+C, which refers to the variables used in the analysis: resistance, intrusion timing, damage, disruption timing, latency, efficiency, and cost. These variables are evaluated using open-source intelligence.\n  Each variable is assigned a specific range of values according to its potential impact on the targeted asset. A matrix is then provided for practical application, which can reveal unexpected vulnerabilities and offer a more granular framework for decision-making and security planning."}

However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models."}

While many systems avoid storing raw fingerprint images in favor of minutiae-based templates, recent research shows that these templates can be reverse-engineered to reconstruct realistic fingerprint images, enabling physical spoofing attacks that compromise user identities with no means of remediation.\n  We present ProxyPrints, the first practical defense that brings cancellable biometrics to existing fingerprint recognition systems without requiring modifications to proprietary matching software. ProxyPrints acts as a transparent middleware layer between the fingerprint scanner and the matching algorithm, transforming each scanned fingerprint into a consistent, unlinkable alias. This transformation allows biometric identities to be revoked and replaced in the event of a breach, without affecting authentication accuracy. Additionally, ProxyPrints provides organizations with breach detection capabilities by enabling the identification of out-of-band spoofing attempts involving compromised aliases.\n  We evaluate ProxyPrints on standard benchmark datasets and commercial fingerprint recognition systems, demonstrating that it preserves matching performance while offering strong security and revocability. Our open-source implementation includes tools for alias generation and deployment in real-world pipelines, making ProxyPrints a drop-in, scalable solution for fingerprint data protection."}

Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation."}

However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments."}

While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude."}

A KV Cache Manipulation Attack", "comment": "7 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "The Key Value(KV) cache is an important component for efficient inference in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs), but its role as a representation of the model's internal state makes it a potential target for integrity attacks. This paper introduces \"History Swapping,\" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior."}

However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}

While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns. Experiments on three benchmarks (ETH/UCY, NBA, and SDD) demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating both its effectiveness and practical efficiency."}

While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs."}

These are internal representations that simulate aspects of the external world, track entities and states, capture causal relationships, and enable prediction of consequences. This contrasts with representations based solely on statistical correlations. A key motivation behind this research direction is that humans possess such mental world models, and finding evidence of similar representations in AI models might indicate that these models \"understand\" the world in a human-like way. In this paper, we use case studies from the philosophy of science literature to critically examine whether the world model framework adequately characterizes human-level understanding. We focus on specific philosophical analyses where the distinction between world model capabilities and human understanding is most pronounced. While these represent particular views of understanding rather than universal definitions, they help us explore the limits of world models."}

Although the existing scheme uses threshold cryptography to mitigate the inference attack, it can not guarantee the verifiability of the aggregation results, making the system vulnerable to the threat of poisoning attack. We construct a partial decryption verifiable threshold multi client function encryption scheme, and apply it to Federated learning to implement the federated learning verifiable threshold security aggregation protocol (VTSAFL). VTSAFL empowers clients to verify aggregation results, concurrently minimizing both computational and communication overhead. The size of the functional key and partial decryption results of the scheme are constant, which provides efficiency guarantee for large-scale deployment. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that vtsafl can achieve the same accuracy as the existing scheme, while reducing the total training time by more than 40%, and reducing the communication overhead by up to 50%. This efficiency is critical for overcoming the resource constraints inherent in Internet of Things (IoT) devices."}

By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings."}

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches.

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation."}

Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems."}

Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively. Notably, RGR-GRPO maintains stable entropy fluctuations during off-policy training and achieves superior pass@k performance, reflecting sustained exploration and effective breakthrough beyond existing performance bottlenecks."}

In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3. Compared to the baselines, the proposed method can improve the security by up to 20%."}

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations."}

These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline.

First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests.

Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users.

While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation."}

We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines.

To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy.

We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments."}

This study presents a comparative analysis of three Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa) for ransomware detection using two structured datasets: UGRansome and Process Memory (PM). Since LLMs are primarily designed for natural language processing (NLP), numerical and categorical ransomware features were transformed into textual sequences using KBinsDiscretizer and token-based encoding. This enabled the models to learn behavioural patterns from system activity and network traffic through contextual embeddings. The models were fine-tuned on approximately 2,500 labelled samples and evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. To ensure transparent decision-making in this high-stakes domain, two explainable AI techniques (LIME and SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions. The results show that the models learn distinct ransomware-related cues: BERT relies heavily on dominant file-operation features, RoBERTa demonstrates balanced reliance on network and financial signals, while DeBERTa exhibits strong sensitivity to financial and network-traffic indicators. Visualisation of embeddings further reveals structural differences in token representation, with RoBERTa producing more isotropic embeddings and DeBERTa capturing highly directional, disentangled patterns. In general, RoBERTa achieved the strongest F1-score, while BERT yielded the highest ROC-AUC performance. The integration of LLMs with XAI provides a transparent framework capable of identifying feature-level evidence behind ransomware predictions."}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions.

In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates."}

To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \\textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness.

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria."}

To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions."}

In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \\lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks."}

In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions."}

Prior security frameworks mitigate these attacks by enforcing forward-only state transitions (state continuity) with hardware-backed mechanisms, but they categorically treat all rollback as malicious and thus preclude legitimate rollbacks used for operational recovery from corruption or misconfiguration. We present Rebound, a general-purpose security framework that preserves rollback protection while enabling policy-authorized legitimate rollbacks of application binaries, configuration, and data. Key to Rebound is a reference monitor that mediates state transitions, enforces authorization policy, guarantees atomicity of state updates and rollbacks, and emits a tamper-evident log that provides transparency to applications and auditors. We formally prove Rebound's security properties and show through an application case study -- with software deployment workflows in GitLab CI -- that it enables robust control over binary, configuration, and raw data versioning with low end-to-end overhead."}

Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.\n  Our approach incorporates two key innovations.

We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems."}

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness."}

In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively.

Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization.

We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps.

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."}

Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts.

However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity. Our results establish practical guidelines for designing and evaluating scalable proof-verification and selection systems."}

A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget."}

We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints."}

Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize.

In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan."}

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks."}

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."}

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems."}

In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark.

We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge."}

Accepted at AI4RWC@WI-IAT 2025", "summary": "Intelligent wearable systems are at the forefront of precision medicine and play a crucial role in enhancing human-machine interaction. Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management."}

The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model.

In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics.

We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.\n  This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528."}

Existing KD backdoor methods are typically complex and computationally intensive: they employ surrogate student models and simulated distillation to guarantee transferability, and they construct triggers in a way similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which being not stealthy in magnitude, inherently exhibit strong adversarial behavior. This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy \"weak\" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, model architectures, and KD methods show that BackWeak is efficient, simpler, and often more stealthy than previous elaborate approaches. This work calls on researchers studying KD backdoor attacks to pay particular attention to the trigger's stealthiness and its potential adversarial characteristics."}

Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users.

Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems."}

When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs."}

This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing.

This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields.

This paper introduces \"History Swapping,\" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior."}

We construct a partial decryption verifiable threshold multi client function encryption scheme, and apply it to Federated learning to implement the federated learning verifiable threshold security aggregation protocol (VTSAFL). VTSAFL empowers clients to verify aggregation results, concurrently minimizing both computational and communication overhead. The size of the functional key and partial decryption results of the scheme are constant, which provides efficiency guarantee for large-scale deployment. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that vtsafl can achieve the same accuracy as the existing scheme, while reducing the total training time by more than 40%, and reducing the communication overhead by up to 50%.

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches.

Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding."}

However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making.\n  In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers."}

In this work, we present AutoMalDesc, an automated static analysis summarization framework that, following initial training on a small set of expert-curated examples, operates independently at scale. This approach leverages an iterative self-paced learning pipeline to progressively enhance output quality through synthetic data generation and validation cycles, eliminating the need for extensive manual data annotation. Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting languages demonstrates statistically significant improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative metrics based on established malware labels with qualitative assessment from both human experts and LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and linguistic coherence of generated summaries. To facilitate reproducibility and advance research in this domain, we publish our complete dataset of more than 100K script samples, including annotated seed (0.9K) and test (3.6K) datasets, along with our methodology and evaluation framework."}

With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks."}

However, most existing work focuses on single-target All-to-One (A2O) attacks, overlooking the more complex All-to-X (A2X) attacks with multiple target classes, which are often assumed to have low attack success rates. In this paper, we first demonstrate that A2X attacks are robust against state-of-the-art defenses. We then propose a novel attack strategy that enhances the success rate of A2X attacks while maintaining robustness by optimizing grouping and target class assignment mechanisms. Our method improves the attack success rate by up to 28%, with average improvements of 6.7%, 16.4%, 14.1% on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. We anticipate that this study will raise awareness of A2X attacks and stimulate further research in this under-explored area. Our code is available at https://github.com/kazefjj/A2X-backdoor ."}

However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines. The code and the appendix are available at https://github.com/SASA-cloud/InfoDecom."}

Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \\textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions."}

In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \\lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks."}

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%."}
