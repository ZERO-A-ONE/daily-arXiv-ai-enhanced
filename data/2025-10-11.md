### [1] [Modeling Developer Burnout with GenAI Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07435)
*Zixuan Feng,Sadia Afroz,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现GenAI采用通过增加工作需求加剧开发者倦怠，但工作资源和积极认知可缓解这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究强调GenAI带来的生产力提升，但忽视了其对开发者福祉的潜在负面影响，特别是倦怠问题。

Method: 采用混合方法研究设计，调查442名开发者，使用PLS-SEM和回归分析建模工作需求、资源与倦怠关系，辅以定性分析。

Result: GenAI采用通过增加工作需求导致倦怠加剧，但工作资源和积极认知能够缓解这种负面影响。

Conclusion: GenAI采用应被视为机遇而非威胁，关键在于提供足够的工作资源和培养积极认知来减轻其负面影响。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

### [2] [HotBugs.jar: A Benchmark of Hot Fixes for Time-Critical Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07529)
*Carol Hanna,Federica Sarro,Mark Harman,Justyna Petke*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HotBugs.jar是首个专门针对真实世界热修复的数据集，包含679个经过手动验证的热修复案例，其中110个可复现，为快速调试、自动修复和生产级弹性工具的研究提供基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管热修复对生产系统至关重要，但目前缺乏专门针对热修复的评估基准，阻碍了相关工具和方法的研究发展。

Method: 从10个Apache项目的19万次提交和15万份问题报告中识别出746个候选热修复，经过手动评估确认679个真实热修复，其中110个可复现并集成到HotBugs.jar框架中。

Result: 成功构建了包含679个手动验证热修复的数据集，其中110个可复现案例包含错误版本、修复版本、测试套件和元数据，已被SBSE会议采纳为官方挑战数据集。

Conclusion: HotBugs.jar填补了热修复研究领域的空白，为现代软件系统的快速调试、自动修复和弹性研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern
software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.

### [3] [RustAssure: Differential Symbolic Testing for LLM-Transpiled C-to-Rust Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07604)
*Yubo Bai,Tapti Palit*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RustAssure是一个使用LLM自动将C代码转换为Rust的系统，通过提示工程和差分符号测试确保生成的Rust代码安全且语义等效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有C代码库需要转换为Rust以利用其内存安全特性，但手动转换耗时且容易出错。

Method: 使用LLM进行自动转换，结合提示工程生成惯用Rust代码，并通过差分符号测试验证C和Rust代码的语义相似性。

Result: 在五个真实应用中，89.8%的C函数成功生成了可编译的Rust函数，其中69.9%的函数在符号返回值上完全等效。

Conclusion: RustAssure能够有效自动转换C代码为Rust，同时通过符号测试确保语义正确性。

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

### [4] [AppForge: From Assistant to Independent Developer -- Are GPTs Ready for Software Development?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07740)
*Dezhi Ran,Yuan Cao,Mengzhou Wu,Simin Chen,Yuzhe Guo,Jun Ren,Zihe Song,Hao Yu,Jialei Wei,Linyi Li,Wei Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Tao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APPFORGE是一个评估LLM构建完整软件系统能力的基准，包含101个真实Android应用开发问题。测试显示当前最佳模型GPT-5仅能开发18.8%功能正确的应用，表明LLM在处理复杂多组件软件工程挑战方面存在根本局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估函数级代码生成，但真实软件开发需要协调整个系统组件、维护状态一致性、处理生命周期和框架约束。缺乏评估LLM构建完整软件系统能力的基准。

Method: 设计多智能体系统自动总结应用文档功能并导航应用合成测试用例，构建包含101个Android应用开发问题的APPFORGE基准，并建立自动化评估框架。

Result: 评估12个主流LLM，所有模型表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-5仅能开发18.8%功能正确的应用。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在处理复杂多组件软件工程挑战方面存在根本局限性，需要进一步研究提升其构建完整软件系统的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

### [5] [Interleaved Learning and Exploration: A Self-Adaptive Fuzz Testing Framework for MLIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07815)
*Zeyu Sun,Jingjing Liang,Weiyi Wang,Chenyao Suo,Junjie Chen,Fanjiang Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLEX是一个基于神经网络的自适应模糊测试框架，专门针对MLIR编译器，通过扰动采样和反馈驱动的增强循环来生成多样化且语义有效的测试用例，显著提高了bug检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于手动模板或规则变异的模糊测试方法难以生成足够多样化和语义有效的测试用例，无法有效检测MLIR复杂代码空间中的深层bug。

Method: FLEX利用神经网络进行程序生成，采用扰动采样策略促进多样性，并通过反馈驱动的增强循环使用崩溃和非崩溃测试用例迭代改进模型。

Result: 在30天测试中发现了80个未知bug，在24小时固定版本比较中检测到53个bug（比最佳基线多3.5倍），代码覆盖率达到28.2%，比次优工具高42%。

Conclusion: FLEX通过神经程序生成和自适应学习，显著提升了MLIR模糊测试的效果，扰动生成和多样性增强是其有效性的关键因素。

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

### [6] [Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834)
*Lingjun Liu,Feiran Qin,Owolabi Legunsen,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IssueMut：首个从编译器bug历史中提取变异算子的方法，通过挖掘bug报告中的程序元素来指导模糊测试，在GCC和LLVM中发现了65个新bug


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器bug影响巨大，现有变异模糊测试器的有效性依赖于变异算子质量，但之前的工作从未利用编译器bug历史作为变异算子来源

Method: 自动化方法从bug报告中挖掘变异算子，并将其集成到现有变异编译器模糊测试器中，从1760个GCC和LLVM bug报告中挖掘了587个变异算子

Result: 在GCC中发现28个新bug，LLVM中发现37个新bug，其中60个被确认或修复，证明bug历史变异算子的有效性

Conclusion: bug历史包含丰富信息，编译器模糊测试器应该利用这些信息来发现更多bug

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

### [7] [An AUTOSAR-Aligned Architectural Study of Vulnerabilities in Automotive SoC Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07941)
*Srijita Basu,Haraldsson Bengt,Miroslaw Staron,Christian Berger,Jennifer Horkoff,Magnus Almgren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了180个公开报告的汽车SoC漏洞，识别了16个根本原因和56个受影响的软件模块，揭示了主要的漏洞模式和关键模块的补丁延迟问题，为汽车CPS平台安全提供了改进检测、优先级排序和定位策略的指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车SoC软件架构在实时安全关键环境中仍存在安全挑战，而针对AUTOSAR对齐架构中SoC相关漏洞的系统性分析尚缺乏，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 分析180个公开报告的汽车SoC漏洞，将其映射到符合AUTOSAR分层抽象和服务导向原则的代表性SoC软件架构模型中。

Result: 识别了16个根本原因和56个受影响的软件模块，发现不同CWE类别和架构层的缓解延迟存在差异，揭示了主导的漏洞模式和补丁延迟较长的关键模块。

Conclusion: 研究为保护汽车CPS平台提供了可操作的见解，包括改进SoC软件架构的检测、优先级排序和定位策略指南。

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

### [8] [Past, Present, and Future of Bug Tracking in the Generative AI Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08005)
*Utku Boran Torun,Mehmet Taha Demircan,Mahmut Furkan Gön,Eray Tüzün*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的AI驱动bug追踪框架，通过智能自动化减少修复时间和人工开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统bug追踪系统依赖人工报告、复现、分类和解决，流程异步且沟通成本高，导致修复延迟和用户挫败感

Method: 用户用自然语言报告问题，AI代理精炼报告、尝试复现并补充缺失细节，分类后无效问题通过无代码修复解决，有效问题定位并分配给开发者，LLM生成候选补丁并由人工监督确保正确性

Result: 框架在每个阶段集成自动化，加速响应时间，改善协作，加强软件维护实践

Conclusion: AI增强的bug追踪框架为更高效、以用户为中心的未来提供了解决方案

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

### [9] [Building Whitespace-Sensitive Languages Using Whitespace-Insensitive Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08200)
*Alexander Hellwig,Nico Jansen,Bernhard Rumpe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过预处理语言构件来使用模块化、空白不敏感的语言模块构建空白敏感语言的技术，旨在提高现有语言组件的可重用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件语言工程中，通过组合模块化语言组件实现可重用性是一种趋势，但空白敏感和空白不敏感语言之间的集成差距严重阻碍了这种可重用性，导致库无法重用，空白敏感语言需要从头开发。

Method: 在解析前预处理语言构件，使用模块化的空白不敏感语言模块来构建空白敏感语言。通过重构简化版Python语言进行评估。

Result: 成功实现了使用现有语言组件构建空白敏感语言的技术，提高了组件的可重用性。

Conclusion: 该解决方案能够提高现有语言组件的可重用性，减少开发时间并提高软件语言的整体质量。

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

### [10] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了PATCH方法，通过识别和编辑语言模型中负责PII泄露的计算电路，在保持模型效用的同时显著减少个人身份信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制如差分隐私虽然能减少PII泄露，但会导致模型效用大幅下降。研究发现特定的PII泄露电路是导致这一问题的根本原因。

Method: 使用电路发现技术识别PII泄露电路，然后直接编辑这些电路来减少泄露，提出了PATCH方法。

Result: PATCH将PII泄露召回率降低了65%，与差分隐私结合后可将残余泄露降至0.01%，在隐私-效用权衡方面优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: PII泄露电路在现有防御机制下仍然存在，而PATCH能有效缓解其影响，提供更好的隐私保护效果。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

*Kalyan Cheerla,Lotfi Ben Othmane,Kirill Morozov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 比较全同态加密(FHE)和混淆电路(GC)在安全神经网络推理中的性能表现，发现GC在速度和内存使用上有优势，而FHE支持非交互式推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在医疗、金融等敏感领域的应用，数据隐私和模型保密性成为重要挑战，需要隐私保护的机器学习方法

Method: 使用Microsoft SEAL库的CKKS方案实现FHE，使用IntelLabs的TinyGarble2.0框架实现GC，构建两层神经网络并在半诚实威胁模型下评估

Result: GC在执行速度和内存消耗方面表现更好，而FHE支持非交互式推理，两者存在权衡关系

Conclusion: FHE和GC在安全神经网络推理中各有优势，选择取决于具体应用场景对交互性和性能的要求

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is making its way into fields such as healthcare,
finance, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and concerns over data privacy
and model confidentiality continue to grow. Privacy-preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without
revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary models. Leveraging Secure Computation
techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work
presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network
inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS
scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework
(GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest
threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory
usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a
trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption,
while FHE supports non-interactive inference.

*Maryam Ataei Nezhad,Hamid Barati,Ali Barati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三阶段的安全通信方法，用于保护物联网中的隐私和信息安全，通过分层加密和认证协议来提高网络安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网的普及带来了严重的隐私和信息安全问题，用户信息被盗的新闻加剧了这些担忧，阻碍了物联网的广泛传播。

Method: 方法分为三个阶段：1）在每个集群内构建星型结构，子节点与父节点共享唯一密钥加密通信；2）集群内多跳通信，每跳使用不同密钥加密，连接结束时更新密钥；3）使用认证协议增强集群间通信安全，验证集群头节点身份。

Result: 使用NS2软件进行仿真，结果表明该方法在能耗、端到端延迟、灵活性、数据包传输率和存活节点数量方面均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的三阶段安全通信方法能有效提升物联网网络的安全性，同时优化了网络性能指标。

Abstract: Internet of Things means connecting different devices through the Internet.
The Internet of things enables humans to remotely manage and control the
objects they use with the Internet infrastructure. After the advent of the
Internet of Things in homes, organizations, and private companies, privacy and
information security are the biggest concern. This issue has challenged the
spread of the Internet of things as news of the users theft of information by
hackers intensified. The proposed method in this paper consists of three
phases. In the first phase, a star structure is constructed within each
cluster, and a unique key is shared between each child and parent to encrypt
and secure subsequent communications. The second phase is for intracluster
communications, in which members of the cluster send their data to the cluster
head in a multi hop manner. Also, in this phase, the data is encrypted with
different keys in each hop, and at the end of each connection, the keys are
updated to ensure data security. The third phase is to improve the security of
inter cluster communications using an authentication protocol. In this way, the
cluster heads are authenticated before sending information to prevent malicious
nodes in the network. The proposed method is also simulated using NS2 software.
The results showed that the proposed method has improved in terms of energy
consumption, end-to-end delay, flexibility, packet delivery rate, and the
number of alive nodes compared to other methods.

### [13] [MIRANDA: short signatures from a leakage-free full-domain-hash scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07479)
*Alain Couvreur,Thomas Debris-Alazard,Philippe Gaborit,Adrien Vinçotte*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Miranda是基于矩阵码的首个全域哈希签名家族，采用GPV范式提供强安全性保证。该方案使用简单的陷门结构，不依赖拒绝采样，签名大小仅90字节，公钥约2.6MB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于矩阵码的GPV范式签名方案，避免复杂拒绝采样过程，简化实现难度，同时保持强安全性。

Method: 使用Gabidulin码作为矩阵空间，基于可解码码的子码陷门结构，通过少量均匀比特绘制确保签名不泄露陷门信息。

Result: 在128位经典安全级别下，签名大小仅90字节，公钥大小约2.6MB，实现了紧凑的签名方案。

Conclusion: Miranda证明了基于矩阵码的GPV签名可行性，提供了简单实现且紧凑的签名方案，为后量子密码学提供了新选择。

Abstract: We present $\mathsf{Miranda}$, the first family of full-domain-hash
signatures based on matrix codes. This signature scheme fulfils the paradigm of
Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan ($\mathsf{GPV}$), which gives strong
security guarantees. Our trapdoor is very simple and generic: if we propose it
with matrix codes, it can actually be instantiated in many other ways since it
only involves a subcode of a decodable code (or lattice) in a unique decoding
regime of parameters. Though $\mathsf{Miranda}$ signing algorithm relies on a
decoding task where there is exactly one solution, there are many possible
signatures given a message to sign and we ensure that signatures are not
leaking information on their underlying trapdoor by means of a very simple
procedure involving the drawing of a small number of uniform bits. In
particular $\mathsf{Miranda}$ does not use a rejection sampling procedure which
makes its implementation a very simple task contrary to other
$\mathsf{GPV}$-like signatures schemes such as $\mathsf{Falcon}$ or even
$\mathsf{Wave}$.
  We instantiate $\mathsf{Miranda}$ with the famous family of Gabidulin codes
represented as spaces of matrices and we study thoroughly its security (in the
EUF-CMA security model). For~$128$ bits of classical security, the signature
sizes are as low as~$90$ bytes and the public key sizes are in the order
of~$2.6$ megabytes.

TL;DR: EMPalm攻击框架通过窃听手掌识别设备发射的电磁信号，能够隐秘地恢复手掌纹和掌静脉图像，对现有生物认证系统构成严重安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手掌识别系统在运行时会无意中发射电磁信号，研究发现这些电磁泄漏包含了手掌生物特征信息，存在被窃取的风险。

Method: 首先分离两种模态的交织传输，识别并组合其信息频率带，然后重建图像。使用扩散模型恢复每个领域特有的细粒度生物特征。

Result: 在7个原型和2个商用设备上测试，EMPalm能以高视觉保真度恢复手掌生物信息，SSIM达0.79，PSNR达29.88 dB，FID低至6.82。对4个先进识别模型的平均欺骗成功率达65.30%。

Conclusion: 手掌识别系统的电磁泄漏构成严重安全漏洞，EMPalm攻击证明了从电磁信号中恢复手掌生物特征的可行性，需要新的防护措施。

Abstract: Palm recognition has emerged as a dominant biometric authentication
technology in critical infrastructure. These systems operate in either
single-modal form, using palmprint or palmvein individually, or dual-modal
form, fusing the two modalities. Despite this diversity, they share similar
hardware architectures that inadvertently emit electromagnetic (EM) signals
during operation. Our research reveals that these EM emissions leak palm
biometric information, motivating us to develop EMPalm--an attack framework
that covertly recovers both palmprint and palmvein images from eavesdropped EM
signals. Specifically, we first separate the interleaved transmissions of the
two modalities, identify and combine their informative frequency bands, and
reconstruct the images. To further enhance fidelity, we employ a diffusion
model to restore fine-grained biometric features unique to each domain.
Evaluations on seven prototype and two commercial palm acquisition devices show
that EMPalm can recover palm biometric information with high visual fidelity,
achieving SSIM scores up to 0.79, PSNR up to 29.88 dB, and FID scores as low as
6.82 across all tested devices, metrics that collectively demonstrate strong
structural similarity, high signal quality, and low perceptual discrepancy. To
assess the practical implications of the attack, we further evaluate it against
four state-of-the-art palm recognition models, achieving a model-wise average
spoofing success rate of 65.30% over 6,000 samples from 100 distinct users.

*Thomas Debris-Alazard,Philippe Gaborit,Romaric Neveu,Olivier Ruatta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于stationary-MinRank问题安全性的加密方案，这是首个仅依赖MinRank问题难度的加密方案，具有搜索到决策的归约特性，效率优于Alekhnovich和Regev的原方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建仅基于MinRank问题难度的加密方案，解决长期以来该领域的开放性问题，同时提供与HQC、Kyber等标准化方案相当的强安全性保证。

Method: 对Alekhnovich和Regev的加密方案进行适配，使其安全性仅基于stationary-MinRank问题的难度，并证明该问题具有搜索到决策的归约特性。

Result: 提出的加密方案具有实际可行性，效率优于原始方案但略低于FrodoKEM，通过引入更多结构可进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: 该方案为基于MinRank问题的加密方案提供了部分解决方案，具有强安全性和实际应用价值，未来可通过结构优化进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Introduced in 2003 and 2005, Alekhnovich and Regev' schemes were the first
public-key encryptions whose security is only based on the average hardness of
decoding random linear codes and LWE, without other security assumptions. Such
security guarantees made them very popular, being at the origin of the now
standardized HQC or Kyber.
  We present an adaptation of Alekhnovich and Regev' encryption scheme whose
security is only based on the hardness of a slight variation of MinRank, the
so-called stationary-MinRank problem. We succeeded to reach this strong
security guarantee by showing that stationary-MinRank benefits from a
search-to-decision reduction. Our scheme therefore brings a partial answer to
the long-standing open question of building an encryption scheme whose security
relies solely on the hardness of MinRank.
  Finally, we show after a thoroughly security analysis that our scheme is
practical and competitive with other encryption schemes admitting such strong
security guarantees. Our scheme is slightly less efficient than FrodoKEM, but
much more efficient than Alekhnovich and Regev' original schemes, with
possibilities of improvements by considering more structure, in the same way as
HQC and Kyber.

Conclusion: 这项工作为探索安全可信的LLM社区开辟了新途径，提供了分析推理后门攻击的综合视角，并指出了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models
(LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves
LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks,
as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks.
Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive
overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting
LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward
providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by
analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and
unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a
unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing
reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also
present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges
alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel
perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy
LLM communities.

### [17] [ANCORA: Accurate Intrusion Recovery for Web Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07806)
*Yihao Peng,Biao Ma,Hai Wan,Xibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ANCORA是一个用于Web应用精确入侵恢复的系统，能够在不进行侵入式插桩的情况下，通过隔离恶意请求的系统调用序列，分别追踪文件和数据库修改，实现选择性回滚和重放恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Web应用恢复面临关键困境：粗粒度快照回滚会导致合法用户数据丢失，而精确移除攻击影响在高并发环境中难以实现，因为难以将文件和数据库修改归因于特定的攻击相关请求。

Method: ANCORA首先隔离单个恶意请求触发的完整系统调用序列。对于文件修改，构建溯源图揭示所有修改；对于数据库操作，引入新颖的时空锚点，使用请求的网络连接元组和活动时间窗口来精确定位数据库操作。然后执行统一回滚和选择性重放恢复。

Result: 在10个Web应用和20个基于CVE的攻击场景中，ANCORA实现了99.9%的恢复准确率，在最坏情况下响应延迟增加19.8%、QPS降低17.8%，恢复吞吐量为每秒110.7个数据库操作和27.2个受影响文件。

Conclusion: ANCORA能够完全移除攻击影响，同时保留并发合法数据，为Web应用提供精确的入侵恢复解决方案。

Abstract: Modern web application recovery presents a critical dilemma. Coarse-grained
snapshot rollbacks cause unacceptable data loss for legitimate users.
Surgically removing an attack's impact is hindered by a fundamental challenge
in high-concurrency environments: it is difficult to attribute resulting file
and database modifications to a specific attack-related request. We present
ANCORA, a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications without
invasive instrumentation. ANCORA first isolates the full sequence of syscalls
triggered by a single malicious request. Based on this sequence, ANCORA
addresses file and database modifications separately. To trace file changes, it
builds a provenance graph that reveals all modifications, including those by
exploit-spawned processes. To attribute database operations, a more difficult
challenge due to connection pooling, ANCORA introduces a novel spatiotemporal
anchor. This anchor uses the request's network connection tuple and active time
window to pinpoint exact database operations. With all malicious file and
database operations precisely identified, ANCORA performs a unified rewind and
selective replay recovery. It reverts the system to a clean snapshot taken
before the attack, then selectively re-applies only legitimate operations to
both the file system and database. This completely removes the attack's effects
while preserving concurrent legitimate data. We evaluated ANCORA on 10 web
applications and 20 CVE-based attack scenarios with concurrency up to 150
connections. Experiments demonstrate ANCORA achieves 99.9% recovery accuracy
with manageable overhead: up to 19.8% response latency increase and 17.8% QPS
decrease in worst cases, and recovery throughput of 110.7 database operations
per second and 27.2 affected files per second, effectively preserving
legitimate data.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型移动代理的实用隐蔽单次越狱攻击，利用应用内提示注入，通过恶意应用在UI文本中嵌入短提示，在人类交互时保持惰性，但在代理通过ADB驱动UI时暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖于显眼的UI覆盖、提升权限或不切实际的威胁模型，限制了隐蔽性和实际适用性。需要研究更实用的UI级攻击方法。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：低权限感知链目标定位、隐蔽用户不可见激活、以及单次提示有效性。使用启发式引导的字符级迭代深化搜索算法进行单次关键词级去毒化以规避设备安全过滤器。

Result: 在多个LVLM后端评估中，包括闭源服务和代表性开源模型，在三个Android应用中观察到单次场景下的高规划和执行劫持率（如GPT-4o：82.5%规划/75.0%执行）。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前移动代理的基本安全漏洞，对自主智能手机操作具有直接影响。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,
keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate
across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we
observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios
(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a
fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate
implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

TL;DR: 提出基于数字孪生的动态去中心化区块链管理机制，通过二级区块链系统实现去中心化决策，在保持去中心化的同时实现动态管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前区块链治理方案在控制与去中心化之间存在权衡，需要解决这一矛盾。

Method: 利用多个由利益相关方控制的数字孪生，组织成二级区块链系统来协调决策并传播到主区块链。

Result: 模拟评估显示该机制能快速达成决策共识，并以最小开销重新配置主区块链。

Conclusion: 该机制能够在保持去中心化的前提下实现区块链的动态管理，解决了控制与去中心化之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current
solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off
between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes
a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital
twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple
digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate
decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary
blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions
to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems
without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and
impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted
through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to
reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain
with minimal overhead.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了CrossRiskEval评估框架，发现LLM防御策略在针对单一风险时会产生意外的跨风险副作用，揭示了冲突纠缠神经元的存在机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM防御策略评估大多孤立进行，忽视了防御措施在不同风险维度（安全性、公平性、隐私性）之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 提出CrossRiskEval综合评估框架，对14个部署了12种不同防御策略的LLM进行实证研究，并进行细粒度的神经元级分析。

Result: 发现三种主要副作用：1）安全防御会间接加剧隐私泄露或偏见输出；2）公平防御增加滥用风险和隐私泄露；3）隐私防御损害安全性并加剧偏见。神经元分析揭示了冲突纠缠神经元的存在。

Conclusion: 呼吁LLM风险评估范式转变，需要采用整体性、交互感知的防御策略评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various
applications, but their deployment in sensitive domains raises significant
concerns. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been
proposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation,
overlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work,
we take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by
defenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness,
and privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation
framework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk
inadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14
defense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal
several alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses
to sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect
privacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of
misuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and
exacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to
uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the
existence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing
sensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency
analysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key
role in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense
deployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward
holistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies.

Motivation: 旨在从通用计算中生成可证明的均匀随机性，通过将微架构时序波动转化为均匀随机性来确保密码学纯度。

Method: 建立了一个连接时序分布特征函数和置换计数概率生成函数的框架，通过几何收敛实现熵纯化，并建立了具有明确界限的收敛定理。

Result: 实验验证显示，在多种平台上实现了每字节超过7.9998比特的香农熵和卡方均匀性。

Conclusion: 该组合定律为从通用计算生成可证明的均匀随机性提供了通用基础，从涌现的计算动力学中确保了密码学纯度。

Abstract: We present the discovery of a fundamental composition law governing conjugate
observables in the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS). The law links the
discrete permutation count Np and the continuous elapsed time T through a
functional relation connecting the characteristic function of timing
distributions to the probability generating function of permutation counts.
This framework enables entropy purification, transforming microarchitectural
timing fluctuations into uniform randomness via geometric convergence. We
establish convergence theorems with explicit bounds and validate the results
experimentally, achieving Shannon entropy above 7.9998 bits per byte and
chi-square uniformity across diverse platforms. The composition law provides a
universal foundation for generating provably uniform randomness from
general-purpose computation, securing cryptographic purity from emergent
computational dynamics.

Result: LLM在多个分类场景中表现出色，可以作为分析网络安全和隐私趋势的实用工具

Conclusion: LLM能够通过其语义理解能力实现有针对性的网站测量研究，为网络安全和隐私分析提供有效支持

Abstract: Web measurements are a well-established methodology for assessing the
security and privacy landscape of the Internet. However, existing top lists of
popular websites commonly used as measurement targets are unlabeled and lack
semantic information about the nature of the sites they include. This
limitation makes targeted measurements challenging, as researchers often need
to rely on ad-hoc techniques to bias their datasets toward specific categories
of interest. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) as a means to enable targeted web measurement studies through their
semantic understanding capabilities. Building on prior literature, we identify
key website classification tasks relevant to web measurements and construct
datasets to systematically evaluate the performance of different LLMs on these
tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may achieve strong performance across
multiple classification scenarios. We then conduct LLM-assisted web measurement
studies inspired by prior work and rigorously assess the validity of the
resulting research inferences. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a
practical tool for analyzing security and privacy trends on the Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量应用修改，而TracE2E旨在为现有和未来应用提供易于集成的数据溯源和合规性解决方案。

Method: 通过中介进程的输入输出来记录溯源信息，并基于记录的溯源信息强制执行数据保护策略（如机密性、完整性）。

Result: TracE2E能够跨节点一致地记录溯源信息，其合规层可以适应多种策略的执行。

Conclusion: TracE2E提供了一种无需大量应用修改即可实现数据可解释性和合规性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents TracE2E, a middleware written in Rust, that can provide
both data explainability and compliance across multiple nodes. By mediating
inputs and outputs of processes, TracE2E records provenance information and
enforces data-protection policies (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) that
depend on the recorded provenance. Unlike existing approaches that necessitate
substantial application modifications, TracE2E is designed for easy integration
into existing and future applications through a wrapper of the Rust standard
library's IO module. We describe how TracE2E consistently records provenance
information across nodes, and we demonstrate how the compliance layer of
TracE2E can accommodate the enforcement of multiple policies.

TL;DR: 将Intel x86-64缓存时序漏洞基准测试套件移植到RISC-V，并评估三个商用RISC-V处理器（T-Head C910、SiFive U54和U74）的安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V指令集架构日益流行，但缺乏评估具体处理器实现安全性的工具。现有工具主要针对Intel x86-64或ARM架构，RISC-V领域存在空白。

Method: 移植Intel x86-64的缓存时序漏洞基准测试套件到RISC-V，使用该基准测试评估三个商用RISC-V处理器的安全性能。

Result: C910处理器表现出更多不同的时序类型，意味着存在更多微架构漏洞源。37.5%的漏洞在所有处理器中都存在，只有6.8%的漏洞在所有核心中都不存在。

Conclusion: 移植的基准测试套件有助于RISC-V处理器设计者早期识别泄漏源，并支持开发相应的防护措施。

Abstract: While interest in the open RISC-V instruction set architecture is growing,
tools to assess the security of concrete processor implementations are lacking.
There are dedicated tools and benchmarks for common microarchitectural
side-channel vulnerabilities for popular processor families such as Intel
x86-64 or ARM, but not for RISC-V. In this paper we describe our efforts in
porting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities
to RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate the security of three
commercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54
and U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing
types than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on
the C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In
addition, our evaluation reveals that $37.5\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered
by the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\%$ are absent from
all cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V
processor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to
support the development of countermeasures.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于Transformer和xLSTM的深度学习入侵检测系统在ADS-B协议安全中的应用，采用迁移学习策略，xLSTM模型在检测性能上表现更优，F1分数达98.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着航空交通管理对易受攻击的ADS-B协议的依赖增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要，需要改进基于AI的入侵检测系统。

Method: 使用迁移学习策略，先在良性ADS-B消息上进行预训练，然后使用包含篡改消息的标记数据进行微调。评估了两种深度学习IDS实现：Transformer编码器和扩展LSTM（xLSTM）网络。

Result: xLSTM-based IDS达到98.9%的F1分数，优于Transformer-based模型的94.3%。在未见攻击测试中验证了xLSTM模型的泛化能力。xLSTM引入7.26秒延迟，在SSR刷新间隔内，但可能对时间关键操作有限制。

Conclusion: xLSTM-based IDS在检测性能上优于现有方法，特别是在识别逐步破坏态势感知的微妙攻击方面，但其延迟可能对某些操作场景构成限制。

Abstract: With the growing reliance on the vulnerable Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol in air traffic management (ATM),
ensuring security is critical. This study investigates emerging machine
learning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two
deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the
other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first
xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving
pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data
containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach
outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that
progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an
F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on
unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.
Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the
xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh
interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.
While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at
the cost of lower detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全同态加密需要将程序表示为布尔或算术电路，但高级语言编程更便捷。现有转译器有限，需要扩展支持更多语言并提高执行效率

Method: 1. 开发Haskell到布尔电路的转译器 2. 实现电路自动并行化评估器，通过并行执行电路各层门操作

Result: 在PIR和AES应用中验证了方法有效性。16线程并行评估时间28秒，100线程8秒。自动并行化方法在某些情况下优于手动并行化

Conclusion: 成功扩展了面向FHE的高级语言范围，实现了有效的自动并行化，为FHE应用开发提供了更便捷的工具

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the evaluation of programs
directly on encrypted data. However, because only basic operations can be
performed on ciphertexts, programs must be expressed as boolean or arithmetic
circuits. This low-level representation makes implementing applications for FHE
significantly more cumbersome than writing code in a high-level language. To
reduce this burden, several transpilers have been developed that translate
high-level code into circuit representations. In this work, we extend the range
of high-level languages that can target FHE by introducing a transpiler for
Haskell, which converts Haskell programs into Boolean circuits suitable for
homomorphic evaluation. Our second contribution is the automatic
parallelization of these generated circuits. We implement an evaluator that
executes gates in parallel by parallelizing each layer of the circuit. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two key applications: Private
Information Retrieval (PIR) and the AES encryption standard. Prior work has
parallelized AES encryption manually. We demonstrate that the automated method
outperforms some but not all manual parallelizations of AES evaluations under
FHE. We achieve an evaluation time of 28 seconds for a parallel execution with
16 threads and an evaluation time of 8 seconds for a parallel execution with
100 threads

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSO系统（如OIDC）无法保证用户隐私，身份提供商可以追踪用户活动。需要一种既能方便认证又能保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 使用Groth的zk-SNARK零知识证明技术，证明用户属于已订阅的服务提供商而不泄露具体身份信息。采用去中心化和可验证的方法设置系统前提条件。

Result: 实现了高安全目标，同时保持最小的存储和延迟成本，证明该研究可用于生产环境。

Conclusion: 提出的零知识证明SSO机制成功解决了OIDC中的隐私问题，在保护用户隐私的同时保持了系统的高效性。

Abstract: User authentication is one of the most important aspects for secure
communication between services and end-users over the Internet. Service
providers leverage Single-Sign On (SSO) to make it easier for their users to
authenticate themselves. However, standardized systems for SSO, such as OIDC,
do not guarantee user privacy as identity providers can track user activities.
We propose a zero-knowledge-based mechanism that integrates with OIDC to let
users authenticate through SSO without revealing information about the service
provider. Our system leverages Groth's zk-SNARK to prove membership of
subscribed service providers without revealing their identity. We adopt a
decentralized and verifiable approach to set up the prerequisites of our
construction that further secures and establishes trust in the system. We set
up high security targets and achieve them with minimal storage and latency

Result: 评估显示Venus显著提高了溯源收集系统的完整性和效率，与传统调度相比保持合理开销，在某些情况下甚至比默认Linux调度器提高了整体运行时间。

Conclusion: 操作系统内核调度器可以有效缓解溯源收集中的超级生产者威胁，Venus学习调度器通过智能资源分配实现了更好的溯源完整性和系统性能。

Abstract: Provenance plays a critical role in maintaining traceability of a system's
actions for root cause analysis of security threats and impacts. Provenance
collection is often incorporated into the reference monitor of systems to
ensure that an audit trail exists of all events, that events are completely
captured, and that logging of such events cannot be bypassed. However, recent
research has questioned whether existing state-of-the-art provenance collection
systems fail to ensure the security guarantees of a true reference monitor due
to the 'super producer threat' in which provenance generation can overload a
system to force the system to drop security-relevant events and allow an
attacker to hide their actions. One approach towards solving this threat is to
enforce resource isolation, but that does not fully solve the problems
resulting from hardware dependencies and performance limitations.
  In this paper, we show how an operating system's kernel scheduler can
mitigate this threat, and we introduce Venus, a learned scheduler for Linux
specifically designed for provenance. Unlike conventional schedulers that
ignore provenance completeness requirements, Venus leverages reinforcement
learning to learn provenance task behavior and to dynamically optimize resource
allocation. We evaluate Venus's efficacy and show that Venus significantly
improves both the completeness and efficiency of provenance collection systems
compared to traditional scheduling, while maintaining reasonable overheads and
even improving overall runtime in certain cases compared to the default Linux
scheduler.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密码学方法在量子计算时代面临严重威胁，需要开发能够抵御量子攻击的网络安全解决方案来保护交通信息物理系统的通信安全。

Method: 通过分析交通信息物理系统的通信协议漏洞，结合后量子密码学技术，并利用人工智能优化算法选择、资源分配和实时威胁适应。

Result: 提出了AI驱动的后量子密码学方法，能够在保持系统性能的同时增强交通信息物理系统的通信安全性和弹性。

Conclusion: 人工智能增强的后量子密码学为交通信息物理系统在量子计算时代提供了有效的网络安全通信保障策略。

Abstract: Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) integrate physical elements,
such as transportation infrastructure and vehicles, with cyber elements via
advanced communication technologies, allowing them to interact seamlessly. This
integration enhances the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of
transportation systems. TCPS rely heavily on cryptographic security to protect
sensitive information transmitted between vehicles, transportation
infrastructure, and other entities within the transportation ecosystem,
ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. Traditional
cryptographic methods have been employed to secure TCPS communications, but the
advent of quantum computing presents a significant threat to these existing
security measures. Therefore, integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into
TCPS is essential to maintain secure and resilient communications. While PQC
offers a promising approach to developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to
quantum attacks, artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance PQC by optimizing
algorithm selection, resource allocation, and adapting to evolving threats in
real-time. AI-driven PQC approaches can improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of PQC implementations, ensuring robust security without
compromising system performance. This chapter introduces TCPS communication
protocols, discusses the vulnerabilities of corresponding communications to
cyber-attacks, and explores the limitations of existing cryptographic methods
in the quantum era. By examining how AI can strengthen PQC solutions, the
chapter presents cyber-resilient communication strategies for TCPS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护机制减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模经验模型与形式验证之间的鸿沟，减少语言模型生成中的幻觉问题，同时保持系统性能。

Method: 基于概率程序语义的约束语义学，在解码时使用语义防护格，结合贪心选择和知识感知安全质量量化事实风险。

Result: TAD防护机制能够有效减少幻觉，且不牺牲系统吞吐量，为大规模模型与形式验证提供了实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD通过形式验证的解码方案成功减少了语言模型的幻觉问题，实现了经验模型与形式验证的有效结合。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网的普及使关键网络物理系统面临复杂多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏上下文感知能力，无法有效应对。

Method: 使用LLM作为语义桥梁，将非结构化遥测数据转换为上下文状态表示，结合多智能体强化学习(MAPPO)学习协作策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和MITRE ATT&CK ICS合成数据集上测试，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式，通过深度融合LLM和MARL实现自适应和弹性安全。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制，而非学习全新能力，来实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型性能提升的本质原因：是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督自下而上方法发现可解释的推理行为。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在合适时机高效部署这些机制。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例，探讨生成式AI如何解决神经心理学容量限制，实现个性化纵向护理路径。建议使用心理健康数字孪生作为个性化心理健康护理的变革性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化、连续的护理方式。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进诊断协调，构建心理健康数字孪生作为持续更新的计算模型。

Result: AI能够有效进行患者数据采样，为动态适应个体需求和病情变化提供可能，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样将改善心理健康护理，心理健康数字孪生框架为个性化护理提供了变革性方向。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，由管理者智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务，并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重新规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也超越了最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务上表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: ProSEA为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空预测框架，通过引入结合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性的SpatioSemantic专家，在交通预测任务上取得了显著改进。研究发现战略性的专家选择比复杂的多专家集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家混合框架如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。需要开发能够结合物理拓扑和数据驱动特征的增强框架。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新型SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合。采用战略性专家选择策略。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs 3.14），在PEMS BAY上改进4.1%（1.65 vs 1.72）。最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+降低53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少但战略性设计的专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时具有优越的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLM的推理能力与时间序列分析工具相结合，专门解决LLM在时间序列推理任务中的幻觉和知识泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，存在幻觉和知识泄露问题，需要专门的方法来提升时间序列推理能力。

Method: 设计TS-Agent代理，让LLM专注于证据收集和结论合成，将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，使用自批判和质量门控机制迭代优化推理过程。

Result: 在基准测试中，TS-Agent在理解任务上达到最先进LLM水平，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型，特别是在零样本设置下表现突出。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过分离LLM推理与时间序列分析，避免了多模态对齐训练，保持了时间序列的原始形式，确保了可解释性和可验证性，有效缓解了知识泄露和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统难以信任，因为错误会在各阶段间静默传递，需要建立可追溯和问责的管道系统来追踪错误来源和分配责任。

Method: 采用Planner→Executor→Critic管道结构，评估了8种配置的三种最先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 研究表明：结构化问责交接显著提高准确性并防止简单管道中的常见故障；模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；准确度-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，在流程分析和优化中展现出深度推理能力，并表现出拟人化特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Conclusion: 从方法论的限制出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统热门路径查询方法需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题具有重要意义。

Method: CompassLLM采用多智能体框架，包含两阶段流程：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时生成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力的性能，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需训练和参数调优的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级、即插即用的澄清模块，通过在智能体间消息传递中插入必要问题来阻止错误传播，显著提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会传播到整个链中），它们经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i) 从精选的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；(ii) 监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问；(iii) 使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了现有评估指标系统性低估了模型在组合推理方面的能力，提出了组匹配分数和测试时匹配(TTM)方法，显著提升了模型性能，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，但研究发现现有评估指标系统性地低估了模型能力，需要更准确的评估方法和性能提升技术。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 方法显著提升了模型性能：SigLIP-B16超越所有先前结果和GPT-4.1；GPT-4.1在Winoground上首次超越估计的人类性能；TTM使SigLIP-B16在MMVP-VLM上超越GPT-4.1，建立新的最优结果。

Conclusion: TTM方法在16个数据集变体上持续提升模型性能，推动了组合推理的前沿发展，即使在缺乏度量诱导效应或组结构的基准测试中仍然有效。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁添加，现有离线策略学习方法在新物品存在时不够安全，需要在保证安全的前提下探索新物品

Method: 开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关安全离线策略梯度方法），并提出DEPL框架（利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化）

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能够在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，实现对新物品的有效探索

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态的安全、一致性和信任推理能力仍然有限，需要系统评估。

Method: 引入可复现的模拟框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全的转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 代理在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅55%，Claude、GPT-4o mini和Qwen-VL的不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行动在误导性视觉下被接受，显示过度信任图像。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在关键限制，该框架为研究多模态安全性、一致性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Motivation: 现有方法将STL奖励函数融入强化学习，但自动推断的奖励代表整个或部分路径的全局评估，无法准确累积局部变化的奖励，稀疏的全局奖励可能导致不收敛和不稳定的训练性能。

Method: 基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，提供因果语义的平滑近似以克服不连续性，使其适用于深度强化学习方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中的多种连续控制基准测试表明，该方法优于现有的相关STL引导RL方法，为深度RL提供了更稳健高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 所提出的STL引导RL方法通过在线因果语义提供了更有效的奖励生成机制，提升了强化学习在实时安全关键系统中的控制合成性能。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚它们是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步骤路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含标注的机理步骤、中间体、类型标签和难度评级；提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难；通过提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严谨基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的综述生成方法通常直接总结大量相关论文，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合层次化引用图（包含基础层、发展层和前沿层），通过横向层内搜索和纵向跨层遍历生成多级摘要，并采用多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，为自动化综述生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Motivation: 解决LLM在医学领域容易出现事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为在这个高风险领域中错误是不可接受的。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子级证据步骤，自动审计推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行低成本验证。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医学关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功解决了源域数据不可访问情况下的图域适应问题，通过生成式图恢复实现了目标图与源域的对齐。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

### [57] [GCPO: When Contrast Fails, Go Gold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07790)
*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO算法中模型无法从全错或全对样本中学习的问题，提高了训练效率和推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在局限性：模型的rollout响应上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对样本中获取知识，限制了小模型推理能力的提升。

Method: 引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型朝着明确正确的更新方向学习。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法通过利用参考答案有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和模型推理的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了SHADOW框架，通过强化学习在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与暴露风险，实现更有效的追捕策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗环境中智能体面临的关键战略权衡：获取信息增强态势感知与暴露位置风险之间的平衡。

Method: 提出SHADOW框架，结合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测的多头序列强化学习方法。

Result: SHADOW追捕者在成功率上优于六个竞争基线，时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

*Yuping Zhou,Siqi Lai,Jindong Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于大语言模型的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理的协作，在城市规模交通网络中实现高效导航和拥堵缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层框架：全局交通分配代理协调区域间战略交通流分布，局部导航代理生成符合全局指令的局部自适应路线。采用协作推理优化机制，通过双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）联合训练代理。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在城际旅行效率和拥堵缓解方面持续优于九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augur是一个完全由LLM驱动的时间序列预测框架，利用LLM的因果推理能力发现和使用协变量间的有向因果关联，通过两阶段师生架构实现准确预测和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示和缺乏可解释性等局限性，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：强大的教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验从时间序列推断有向因果图；轻量级学生代理细化图并在高置信度因果关联上进行微调，这些关联被编码为丰富的文本提示用于预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法进行广泛实验，Augur实现了有竞争力的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，展示了LLM在时间序列预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注孤立能力而非整体性能，深度研究系统需要综合多种来源、生成见解并呈现连贯发现，这些能力难以简单验证。

Method: 引入DeepResearch-ReportEval框架，通过研究报告评估深度研究系统，系统测量三个维度：质量、冗余性和事实性，采用创新的LLM-as-a-Judge方法。

Result: 建立了包含100个精选查询的标准化基准，涵盖12个现实世界类别，评估了四个领先商业系统，揭示了不同的设计理念和性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度研究系统从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的演进提供了基础性见解，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出"有意义透明度"概念，旨在让公众能够理解和参与影响其生活的AI系统，将理解与行动潜力联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在政府服务中应用广泛，但往往存在偏见和错误输出，降低了公民和公职人员的决策参与权。现有透明度实践过于技术化，难以被公众理解且缺乏行动指导。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义透明度的理论框架，强调透明度应连接理解与行动潜力，使公众能够有效参与AI决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决AI系统在公共部门应用中问题的关键，需要超越技术对象，关注社会物质背景和公众参与能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了LLM金融代理存在"利润幻象"问题，即回测收益因LLM信息泄露而无法泛化，并提出了FactFin框架来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理存在信息泄露问题，导致回测收益在知识窗口结束后消失，缺乏真正的泛化能力。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，通过反事实扰动迫使LLM代理学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有基线方法中表现出最佳的外样本泛化能力，实现了优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效解决了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和实际交易表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，用于实现基于LLM的个性化智能代理长期交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI代理控制单元时缺乏个性化交互能力，RAG方法虽然增强了上下文感知但无法结合用户特定数据，现有个性化研究多为概念性而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一的个性化定义，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，开发集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估，指标包括检索准确率、响应正确性和BertScore，并通过5天试点用户研究获得关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究初步表明集成持久记忆和用户档案有潜力提高LLM代理的适应性和感知个性化，为未来工作提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式（SFT、DPO、RLVR）在长尾查询泛化、细粒度监督和推理一致性方面存在局限，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 核心是SRPO算法，结合生成式步进奖励模型和人工标注验证器的混合奖励，辅以多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了性能，还增强了可解释性和鲁棒性，为电商搜索相关性分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Method: 创建包含英语、印地语和5种其他印度语言的5500多个合成语音查询，使用基于说话人嵌入的新型采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性，评估工具选择准确性、结构一致性和工具调用正确性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距和关键限制。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench填补了语音代理评估的空白，暴露了现有模型在多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性方面的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI代理在模糊、动态和冲突任务场景中的信息困境问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户在任务执行过程中的主动参与，导致在信息困境（模糊、动态变化、冲突）场景下无法适应用户真实需求和偏好。

Method: 提出ReInAgent框架，包含三个专门智能体：信息管理智能体（基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互）、决策智能体（冲突感知规划）、反思智能体（任务反思和信息一致性验证），围绕共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境问题，产生的执行结果更符合用户真实偏好。在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的人机协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的限制，能够在复杂现实场景中实现更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在处理数值时并非连续表示，而是引入显著噪声，尽管能够高精度重建原始数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与简单数值输入空间正交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及它们在数值表示中的实际表现。

Method: 使用三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型，通过线性重建和主成分分析评估嵌入空间的预期属性。

Result: 虽然重建可以达到高保真度（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，表明许多嵌入空间组件与简单数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型在数值表示上存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have

*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR通过基于推理阶段熵的奖励机制，在保持准确性的同时有效缩短大型推理模型的响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理过程往往过长且冗余，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，根据推理阶段的不同熵值进行差异化奖励：在思考阶段惩罚过高熵值，在答案阶段允许适度探索，从而鼓励生成简洁但有效的推理过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确率，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于推理阶段熵的奖励设计是控制模型响应长度的有效方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能欠佳和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示相对稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保持任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保留通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过考虑注意力参数的功能差异，为参数高效微调提供了一种更有效的方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景之间的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡命令遵循准确性和真实世界驾驶环境真实性方面存在困难，通常通过将场景限制在2D或开放循环模拟中来降低场景描述复杂度，从而牺牲了真实性。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来细化生成精度，通过自然语言和闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的具有不同关键性的场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其细化模块有效降低初始输出中的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力，成功弥合了自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有符合选择方法仅限于单阈值场景，无法满足实际应用中多条件选择的需求

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，针对合取条件引入了具有区域单调性的新型非符合性评分，针对析取条件采用全局Benjamini-Hochberg过程

Result: 实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，在不同条件组合、现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面表现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: MCCS方法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，为资源受限应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，在电商平台评论质量评估中验证有效，提升用户浏览量和转化率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法无法跨领域扩展、难以适应动态内容模式的问题，以及深度学习模型缺乏可解释性、过度关注语义而非质量的问题。

Method: 模仿人类研究过程，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，自主实现工具操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。

Result: 在亿级用户平台部署，A/B测试显示平均每用户评论浏览量增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提升0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征，为质量评估提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除敏感信息及其代理，使用OWL 2 QL本体工程定义敏感属性并通过逻辑推理推断代理，构建捕获偏见模式的σ代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性，确保AI系统的完全公平性，特别是在贷款审批等任务中，代理变量（如邮政编码）可能揭示种族信息。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性并推断代理，构建σ代数G捕获偏见模式，通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输生成与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性。

Result: 该方法保证了真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关，通过将偏见建模为σ代数间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平转换。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可证明和数学基础的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统，确保在敏感任务中的完全公平性。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地集成到AI驱动的决策支持系统中，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止无意中引导用户做出风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究通过多样化的经济场景，重点考察性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操纵性，来评估语言模型复制人类风险偏好的能力。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索和响应生成来解决对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话AI系统中延迟与质量的根本矛盾：轻量级模型响应快但缺乏推理深度，而工具增强的ReAct代理虽然提高了事实准确性，但同步执行导致检索过程中交互阻塞。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）和异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现持续对话流。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，证明了在不牺牲响应质量的前提下显著降低延迟的可行性。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步骤推理任务的长视野推理基准，并使用该数据通过验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)训练模型。

Result: 评估发现最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理中性能显著下降，存在有限的有效推理长度和思考预算分配问题。使用R-HORIZON进行RLVR训练不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提升了7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，技术可能编码狭隘利益并限制公众代理权。虽然语言、视觉和编码的能力基准很常见，但缺乏公开、可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，从公共工件和独立评估中编码可验证实践，明确处理"未知"证据。

Result: 建立了包含协议、代码本、评分脚本和证据图的开放维护系统，报告了试点提供商结果，并通过评分者一致性、覆盖范围报告、跨指数相关性和敏感性分析评估可靠性。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据，相对于邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架进行定位。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好关系获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次成对比较就能获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，显著降低了认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法如模糊偏好关系和Saaty乘法偏好关系需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重、存在不一致风险且计算复杂，限制了其应用。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法通过设计确保一致性，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2降至m个参数。

Result: 该方法与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于Web的工具展示其在实际决策场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: TTM方法克服了传统成对比较方法的局限性，通过减少比较次数、确保一致性并降低认知负担，为多准则决策提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Conclusion: DODO算法成功展示了智能体通过干预自主学习因果结构的可行性，为因果AI发展提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku

### [84] [Chain-of-Trigger: An Agentic Backdoor that Paradoxically Enhances Agentic Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08238)
*Jiyang Qiu,Xinbei Ma,Yunqing Xu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现长期控制，攻击成功率接近100%且误触发率接近零，同时意外增强了智能体在良性任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧。传统后门攻击仅限于单步控制，需要开发能够实现长期智能体控制的多步后门攻击方法。

Method: CoTri基于有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操纵，使智能体偏离预定任务。该方法还通过训练数据建模环境的随机性。

Result: CoTri实现了接近完美的攻击成功率(ASR)和接近零的误触发率(FTR)。由于训练数据建模了环境的随机性，CoTri的植入反而增强了智能体在良性任务上的性能，并提高了对环境干扰的鲁棒性。在视觉语言模型上的验证证实了其可扩展到多模态智能体。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了智能体内稳定、多步的控制，同时提高了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，并带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

TL;DR: Co-TAP是一个三层代理交互协议，通过HAI、UAP和MEK三个核心协议解决多智能体系统在互操作性、交互协作和知识共享方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在三个核心维度面临的挑战：互操作性、交互协作和知识共享，为构建高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供基础。

Method: 设计了三层协议框架：HAI（人机交互协议）标准化信息流，UAP（统一代理协议）实现异构代理互通，MEK（记忆提取知识协议）建立认知链实现知识共享。

Result: 提出了一个完整的协议框架，能够确保实时性能、可靠性、协同交互，实现底层网络无缝互联，并为集体智能奠定基础。

Conclusion: Co-TAP协议框架为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供了坚实的工程基础和理论指导。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用摊销优化加速相关优化问题的解决，通过学习利用问题实例间共享结构的映射。

Method: 使用尺度等变图元网络(ScaleGMNs)，直接在权重空间操作，实现单次微调。

Result: 实证证明该方法的有效性，并提供理论结果：卷积神经网络中的缩放对称性诱导的规范自由度比多层感知器更小。

Conclusion: 对称感知的元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的强大方法。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大型语言模型在数学推理中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。研究提出基于问题感知的早停方法，可减少24.5%的推理token，精度仅下降2.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理能力上取得显著进展，但反思对性能提升的具体贡献尚不明确。本文旨在系统分析反思行为的作用机制。

Method: 在五个数学数据集上分析八个推理模型的输出轨迹，构建不同反思步数的SFT数据集进行训练，并提出问题感知的早停方法动态截断反思过程。

Result: 反思行为主要是确认性的，很少改变模型的初始答案。训练更多反思步数主要提升首次答案正确率，而非通过反思修正错误的能力。早停方法可显著减少推理token。

Conclusion: 反思在推理中主要起确认作用而非修正作用，提出的早停方法能有效提升推理效率，在保持精度的同时大幅减少计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大量采样时可能反映的是随机猜测的成功率而非真实推理能力，导致对RLVR模型能力边界的误判。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，测量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，通过可靠性阈值来过滤随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau重新评估RLVR模型，发现与Pass@1相比，流行算法的相对排名发生了变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地反映模型的真实推理能力边界，特别是在离散答案空间的任务中，为模型评估提供了更可靠的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出语义相似度评分(SSR)方法，使用LLMs生成文本响应并通过嵌入相似度映射到Likert分布，解决传统消费者调研的偏见和规模限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者调研存在面板偏见和规模限制，成本高昂。LLMs虽能模拟合成消费者，但直接获取数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：先让LLMs生成文本响应，然后通过嵌入相似度将这些文本映射到参考陈述的Likert分布上。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调研数据集(9300个人类响应)上测试，SSR达到人类测试-重测信度的90%，同时保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，还能提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持传统调研指标和可解释性的同时，实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在困难，而基于强化学习的搜索代理虽然前景广阔，但仍面临泛化和部署挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理，通过多步决策过程使用强化学习训练，最大化检索质量并支持准确的下游答案。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在QA任务中表现出色，可作为即插即用模块进行实际部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过关注有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，解决了传统RAG和RL搜索代理的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型的幻觉对其可信部署至关重要，现有基于不确定性的检测框架存在局限，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 通过测量多个模型输出和不同层隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示谱分析提供可解释的语义变化洞察。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实践效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 采用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比目标进行视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上表现出与多模态基线相当或更优的性能。动态门控机制发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督即可为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能，但挑战约束存在信息瓶颈和训练不稳定性等局限性。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，传统LLM缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有MLE方法的知识传递受限，无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自进化能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 提出AutoMLGen框架，集成领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索(MCGS)实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，结合细粒度操作符集提高稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算下（标准运行时间的一半）在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过结合领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索，有效解决了机器学习工程任务中的性能优化问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂MLE场景中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs学习何时停止信息收集，在医疗诊断和数学问题解决中提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中战略性地收集相关信息，然后才执行任务。战略信息收集要求模型不仅知道如何有效获取信息，还要知道何时停止收集并做出决策，以避免过度思考或偏离正轨。

Method: CaRT通过反事实轨迹对微调LLMs：一个轨迹在适当时候终止，另一个是相同轨迹的微小修改版本但不应终止。训练LLM通过语言推理解释终止决策的合理性，并将这种能力注入基础LLM。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT方法有效教导LLMs何时停止寻求信息，通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练，在多个领域都表现出更好的信息收集效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序细调，同时在八个保留基准上监控通用能力；使用输出令牌分布分析和计数偏差探针来追踪遗忘行为；提出了两种参数更新策略：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up层而冻结Down投影。

Result: 观察到细调后的遗忘现象可以在后续阶段部分恢复；识别出的两种参数更新方法能够在获得强目标技能提升的同时，基本保持保留任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性参数更新策略，可以有效缓解大型多模态模型在顺序学习中的遗忘问题，实现新技能学习与原有能力保持的良好平衡。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
