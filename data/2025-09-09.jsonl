In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial\nbug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR\nsystems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a\ncomprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the\nvulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our\ndemonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum\nof strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines.

While software\norganizations are recommended to conduct postmortems, the effectiveness and\nadoption of these practices vary widely. Understanding how engineers gather,\ndocument, share, and apply lessons from failures is essential for improving\nreliability and preventing recurrence. High-reliability organizations (HROs)\noften develop software systems where failures carry catastrophic risks,\nrequiring continuous learning to ensure reliability. These organizations\nprovide a valuable setting to examine practices and challenges for learning\nfrom software failures. Such insight could help develop processes and tools to\nimprove reliability and prevent recurrence. However, we lack in-depth industry\nperspectives on the practices and challenges of learning from failures.\n  To address this gap, we conducted a case study through 10 in-depth interviews\nwith research software engineers at a national space research center. We\nexamine how they learn from failures: how they gather, document, share, and\napply lessons. To assess transferability, we include data from 5 additional\ninterviews at other HROs. Our findings provide insight into how engineers learn\nfrom failures in practice. To summarize: (1) failure learning is informal, ad\nhoc, and inconsistently integrated into SDLC; (2) recurring failures persist\ndue to absence of structured processes; and (3) key challenges, including time\nconstraints, knowledge loss from turnover and fragmented documentation, and\nweak process enforcement, undermine systematic learning. Our findings deepen\nunderstanding of how software engineers learn from failures and offer guidance\nfor improving failure management practices."}

However, urban road\nnetworks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate\nrepresentation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The\nperformance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more\nfrom incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in\ncomplex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the\nmost competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework\nfor developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights\ndistinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow\nheterogeneity of spatial interactions."}

However, most\nexisting frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web\nautomation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,\nmulti-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with\ncustomized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial\nreasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level\nplanner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to\nspecialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then\ndesign a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs\nadaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the\nquery, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)\noperate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces\ncognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise\ncoordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse\ngeospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and\nMapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented\nand agentic baselines.

In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven\ntable reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool\ninvocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox\nenvironment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)\nexhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt\nstrategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning\nparadigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised\nfine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool\nusage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize\nmulti-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy\nOptimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality\ntrajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of\nlow-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and\nmore accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks\ndemonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to\ncompetitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy\nand computational precision."}

We demonstrate that this vulnerability\npersists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or\ntargeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps.\nFirst, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's\npotential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding\nattacks and adversarial patch attacks. Evaluations on a public AD dataset\ndemonstrate that our attacks can degrade mapping accuracy by up to 9.9%, render\nup to 44% of targeted routes unreachable, and increase unsafe planned\ntrajectory rates, colliding with real-world road boundaries, by up to 27%.\nThese attacks are also validated on a real-world testbed vehicle. We further\nanalyze root causes of the symmetry bias, attributing them to training data\nimbalance, model architecture, and map element representation. To the best of\nour knowledge, this study presents the first vulnerability assessment of online\nmap construction models and introduces the first digital and physical attack\nagainst them."}

Across models and\ntasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in\nmath late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,\nvague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts\nreliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;\nspeed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and\ndrives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation\nmoves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little\nsemantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,\nelaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration\nmeasurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or\nswitch strategies."}

One prominent line of research addresses these\nlimitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically\nreshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These\nimages can then be classified based on their textural information using\ncomputer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware\nmore effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D\nimages results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,\ncaused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D\ndependencies which do not exist in the original data.

Layer 2 Rollups (L2s) are a faster alternative to\nconventional blockchains. L2s perform most computations offchain using\nminimally blockchains (L1) under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer\nis a service that receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches these\ntransactions, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Using hashing\nneeds less L1 space, which is beneficial for gas cost, but requires a data\navailability committee (DAC) service to translate hashes into their\ncorresponding batches of transaction requests. The behavior of sequencers and\nDACs influence the evolution of the L2 blockchain, presenting a potential\nsecurity threat and delaying L2 adoption. We propose in this paper fraud-proof\nmechanisms, arbitrated by L1 contracts, to detect and generate evidence of\ndishonest behavior of the sequencer and DAC. We study how these fraud-proofs\nlimit the power of adversaries that control different number of sequencer and\nDACs members, and provide incentives for their honest behavior. We designed\nthese fraud-proof mechanisms as two player games. Unlike the generic\nfraud-proofs in current L2s (designed to guarantee the correct execution of\ntransactions), our fraud-proofs are over pred-etermined algorithms that verify\nthe properties that determine the correctness of the DAC. Arbitrating over\nconcrete algorithms makes our fraud-proofs more efficient, easier to\nunderstand, and simpler to prove correct.
