Here, we show, for\nthe first time, that side-channel attacks are, in fact, a concrete serious\nthreat to existing industrial grade 3D printers, enabling the reconstruction of\nthe model printed (regardless of employing ways to directly conceal the design,\ne.g. by encrypting it in transit and before loading it into the printer).\nPreviously, such attacks were demonstrated only on fairly simple FDM desktop 3D\nprinters, which play a negligible role in manufacturing of valuable designs. We\nfocus on the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM process, which is popular for\nmanufacturing net-shaped parts with both polymers and metals. We demonstrate\nhow its individual actuators can be instrumented for the collection of power\nside-channel information during the printing process. We then present our\napproach to reconstruct the 3D printed model solely from the collected power\nside-channel data. Further, inspired by Differential Power Analysis, we\ndeveloped a method to improve the quality of the reconstruction based on\nmultiple traces. We tested our approach on two design models with different\ndegrees of complexity. For different models, we achieved as high as 90.29~\\% of\nTrue Positives and as low as 7.02~\\% and 9.71~\\% of False Positives and False\nNegatives by voxel-based volumetric comparison between reconstructed and\noriginal designs.

While we leverage LLMs for\ninitial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human\nvalidation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study\nyields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly\nexpanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by\nimplementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC\ntools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security\nsmells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended\nperiods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the\npossibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper\ninvestigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness\nand on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound,\nas they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable\nagent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may\nlead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail\nmechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution\nof each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs\nin test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose\na definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case\nexecution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six\nSigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging\nfrom 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current\nlimitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that\nMeta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case\nexecution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma).

To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score.

We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections\nunder RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to\nconverge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of\ndisruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even\nagents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply\nchain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher\nunder RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides\nfinancial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and\ncascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies."}

Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can\nbe easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating\nidentification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources\nbeing auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables.

Moreover,\nwhen multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a\nvariable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the\nlatent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph.

However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental\nfeedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.\nWe propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of\nrelying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of\nhigh-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate\nplans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and\nselects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using\nhigh-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as\nestimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.\nResults in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC\noutperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving\nan average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in\nquery costs."}

We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy:\nfirst, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset\nwith scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform,\nAnsible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some\nautomation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for\ninitial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human\nvalidation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study\nyields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly\nexpanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by\nimplementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC\ntools, often achieving 1.00 precision score.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the\npossibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper\ninvestigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness\nand on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound,\nas they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable\nagent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may\nlead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail\nmechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution\nof each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs\nin test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose\na definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case\nexecution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six\nSigma.
