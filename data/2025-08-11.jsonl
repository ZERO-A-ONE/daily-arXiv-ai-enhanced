Generative AI tools are increasingly used in\ndevelopment workflows, but their suggestions often overlook dependency\nevaluation, emphasize popularity over suitability, and lack reproducibility.\nThis creates risks for projects that require transparency, long-term\nreliability, maintainability, and informed architectural decisions. This study\nformulates software package selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making\n(MCDM) problem and proposes a data-driven framework for technology evaluation.\nAutomated data pipelines continuously collect and integrate software metadata,\nusage trends, vulnerability information, and developer sentiment from GitHub,\nPyPI, and Stack Overflow. These data are structured into a decision model\nrepresenting relationships among packages, domain features, and quality\nattributes. The framework is implemented in PySelect, a decision support system\nthat uses large language models to interpret user intent and query the model to\nidentify contextually appropriate packages. The approach is evaluated using\n798,669 Python scripts from 16,887 GitHub repositories and a user study based\non the Technology Acceptance Model.

This integration allows the system to encode vehicle\nsurroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately\nmodel long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the\n\\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a\nfeature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic\nurban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model\nby visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,\nproviding insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on\nthe CARLA simulator demonstrate that \\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing\nmodels across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory\naccuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving."}

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that\ntransforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals,\nintroducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs\nMultivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal\nscales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral\nsequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are\nencoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,\nwhile the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match\nthe encoder's output dimension.

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

Traditional models often struggle to capture\nsemantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based\nsolutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To\nbridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates\nsemantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into\ntwo structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts\n(e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral\nabstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation\nto encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned\nindependently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision\nmodule. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that\nseparates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness\nunder severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets\ndemonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection\naccuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with\nstructured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for\nreal-world insider threat detection.

However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat\nevent sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and\nmultiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that\ntransforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals,\nintroducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs\nMultivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal\nscales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral\nsequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are\nencoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,\nwhile the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match\nthe encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused\nto construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a\nmultilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on\nthe CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score."}

This study introduces a genetic\nalgorithm-based method for test input generation that innovatively integrates\ngenetic operators and adaptive learning to enhance software vulnerability\ndetection. A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator,\nwhich facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential\ntest inputs. Complementing this, an adaptive feedback mechanism continuously\nlearns from the system's execution behavior and dynamically guides input\ngeneration toward promising areas of the input space. Rather than relying on\nfixed or randomly selected inputs, the approach evolves a population of\nstructurally valid test cases using feedback-driven selection, enabling deeper\nand more effective code traversal. This strategic integration of exploration\nand exploitation ensures that both diverse and targeted test inputs are\ndeveloped over time. Evaluation was conducted across nine open-source\nJSON-processing libraries. The proposed method achieved substantial\nimprovements in coverage compared to a benchmark evolutionary fuzzing method,\nwith average gains of 39.8% in class coverage, 62.4% in method coverage, 105.0%\nin line coverage, 114.0% in instruction coverage, and 166.0% in branch\ncoverage.

To better understand the contribution of the retrieved cross-file\ncontexts, we introduce a likelihood-based metric to evaluate the impact of each\nretrieved code chunk on the completion. Our analysis reveals that, despite\nretrieving numerous chunks, only a small subset positively contributes to the\ncompletion, while some chunks even degrade performance. To address this issue,\nwe leverage this metric to construct a repository-level dataset where each\nretrieved chunk is labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on its\nrelevance to the target completion. We then propose an adaptive retrieval\ncontext filtering framework, CODEFILTER, trained on this dataset to mitigate\nthe harmful effects of negative retrieved contexts in code completion.\nExtensive evaluation on the RepoEval and CrossCodeLongEval benchmarks\ndemonstrates that CODEFILTER consistently improves completion accuracy compared\nto approaches without filtering operations across various tasks. Additionally,\nCODEFILTER significantly reduces the length of the input prompt, enhancing\ncomputational efficiency while exhibiting strong generalizability across\ndifferent models. These results underscore the potential of CODEFILTER to\nenhance the accuracy, efficiency, and attributability of repository-level code\ncompletion."}
