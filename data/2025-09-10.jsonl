Traditional Object-Oriented\nProgramming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality,\nleading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study\ninvestigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure\nsoftware development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a\ncase study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features\nincluding authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging,\nand session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches.\nData collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code,\ncoupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics\n(response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators.\nDeveloper feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging\nexperiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality\nmodel, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings\ndemonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of\nsecurity mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead.

VFCs encode precise code\nchanges, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset\nconstruction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore\ncritical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on sparse, often\nnoisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the\nvulnerability descriptions. To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a\nnovel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links\nbetween vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates\nembeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing\ndetailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated\nmessages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap\nbetween natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach\nPatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the\nbest-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset.

Existing methods in this field primarily\nsupport tactical decision-making, where simulations start from an empty state\nand aim to estimate the long-term effects of process changes.

An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation\nup to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and\nmeasure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the\ncurrent state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies\nan alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation\nof the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper\naddresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a\nsimulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start\nfrom the current state of cases and resources?

Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external\nbehavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable\ncost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding\nwhy developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may\nsupport wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%.

Most motivations were\npragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related\nto developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation\nwith motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs\neffectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural\nreasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when\ncombined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches.

Skin nerve activity (SKNA)\nextracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a\nnoninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible\nto electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on\nbandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to\noverlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained\nmuscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight\none-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nbottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using\nclean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise\nfrom chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at\nrealistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the\nmodel in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation\nwith clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to\nnear-clean discriminability (AUROC $\\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline\nversus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies\nof 91--98\\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results\ndemonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve\nphysiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG\ninterference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,\nmovement-rich environments."}

Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users\ncan synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other\neasily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate\ntopic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and\nincreasing the likelihood of success.\n  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated\nphishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a\nresult, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify\nthem reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,\nthey suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the\nperformance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for\nlarge-scale deployment.\n  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds\ntrigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,\ncreating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates\ncontent related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,\nenabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit\ntriggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work.

To mitigate these threats,\nmodern engines increasingly adopt software-based fault isolation (SFI). A\nprominent example is Google's V8 heap sandbox, which represents the most widely\ndeployed SFI mechanism, protecting billions of users across all Chromium-based\nbrowsers and countless applications built on Node.js and Electron. The heap\nsandbox splits the address space into two parts: one part containing trusted,\nsecurity-sensitive metadata, and a sandboxed heap containing memory accessible\nto untrusted code.

These models operate with a thinking\nbudget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a\nsolution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator\nframework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model\nperiodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a\nconfident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty\nthreshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability\nby allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging\nfurther reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the\nAIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)\nimproves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended\nmulti-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing\nvariance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based\ngrading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate\nmillions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty\nthresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a\npowerful signal for reasoning sufficiency.

We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature.
