### [1] [ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20380)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM是专门针对生成OpenACC指令进行微调的两个开源大语言模型，能够为数据并行循环生成专家级OpenACC指令，显著提升了指令生成的准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GPU的普及和并行编程框架的复杂性增加，虽然基于指令的编程标准如OpenACC简化了GPU编程，但仍需要专业知识才能有效使用这些指令。

Method: 通过从GitHub的C/C++仓库中挖掘4,033个OpenACC pragma-loop对构建监督微调数据集，其中3,223对用于训练，810对用于测试，并基于此数据集对LLM进行微调。

Result: 在测试集上，基础LLM无法稳定生成有效pragma，而微调后的模型能为87%的数据并行循环生成正确指令类型的pragma，50%的情况下能生成完全匹配的pragma。即使不完全匹配，生成的pragma也经常包含正确的子句，具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM项目通过公开代码、模型和数据集，旨在为LLM驱动的OpenACC pragma生成建立可复现的基准，降低串行程序自动GPU卸载的门槛。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

*Nishant Gaurav,Adit Akarsh,Ankit Ranjan,Manoj Bajaj*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Dynamic ReAct是一种新方法，使ReAct智能体能够在超出大型语言模型上下文记忆限制的庞大MCP工具集中高效运行。该方法通过渐进式工具选择架构，在保持任务完成准确性的同时将工具加载量减少高达50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在包含数百或数千个可用工具的环境中，同时加载所有工具计算不可行的问题，实现智能工具选择以应对大规模工具集的挑战。

Method: 提出并评估了五种不同的架构，逐步优化工具选择过程，最终形成搜索-加载机制，以最小的计算开销实现智能工具选择。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持任务完成准确性的同时，将工具加载量减少了高达50%。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了真正通用AI智能体的发展，使其能够动态适应多样化的任务环境。

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

### [4] [Towards Systematic Specification and Verification of Fairness Requirements: A Position Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20387)
*Qusai Ramadan,Jukka Ruohonen,Abhishek Tiwari,Adam Alami,Zeyd Boukhers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出基于知识图谱的框架来解决软件系统中公平性需求规范化和验证的缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将软件系统的歧视性行为归因于算法设计缺陷或数据偏见，但忽视了公平性需求规范化和验证的重要性。专家关于公平性的知识往往是隐性的，难以形式化表达和验证。

Method: 借鉴安全工程领域的经验，提出开发基于知识图谱的框架来形式化公平性知识，辅助需求规范和验证。

Result: 本文讨论了相关挑战、研究问题，并提出了解决这些研究问题的路线图。

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法有望为公平性需求工程提供形式化机制，弥补当前公平性规范化和验证工具的缺失。

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

### [5] [Online-Optimized RAG for Tool Use and Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20415)
*Yu Pan,Xiaocheng Li,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了Online-Optimized RAG框架，通过在线梯度更新解决检索增强生成中的嵌入对齐问题，提高工具选择和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中由于不完美的嵌入模型或噪声描述导致的嵌入对齐问题，这种对齐错误可能导致检索错误和任务失败。

Method: 引入部署时框架，通过最小反馈（如任务成功）从实时交互中持续适应检索嵌入，应用轻量级在线梯度更新，不改变底层LLM。

Result: 在多样化工具使用和文档检索场景中，该方法持续提高工具选择准确性和最终任务成功率。

Conclusion: Online-Optimized RAG为构建稳健、自我改进的RAG系统提供了简单实用的路径。

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

*Reiner Hähnle,Cosimo Laneve,Adele Veschetti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Stipula是一种用于建模法律合同的领域特定编程语言，本文提出通过将Stipula合同翻译为带有JML规范的Java代码，并使用KeY工具进行形式化验证的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保涉及资产转移和义务的法律合同具有可执行属性，需要一种形式化验证方法来保证合同的正确性。

Method: 将Stipula合同自动翻译为带有Java Modeling Language注解的Java代码，然后使用KeY演绎验证工具进行部分和完全正确性验证。

Result: 对于具有不相交循环的大型Stipula合同子集，翻译和验证过程完全自动化，验证成功。

Conclusion: 通用目的的演绎验证工具可以成功应用于翻译方法中，为法律合同的正确性验证提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

### [7] [AI-Specific Code Smells: From Specification to Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20491)
*Brahim Mahmoudi,Naouel Moha,Quentin Stievenert,Florent Avellaneda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SpecDetect4AI是一个基于工具的AI特定代码异味检测方法，使用声明式领域特定语言进行规则规范，并在826个AI系统中达到88.66%的精确度和88.89%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的兴起带来了新的软件问题，现有检测工具往往无法识别AI特定的代码异味，这些异味可能导致不可重现性、静默失败或模型泛化能力差等问题。

Method: 结合高级声明式领域特定语言进行规则规范，以及可扩展的静态分析工具来检测AI系统中的代码异味。

Result: 在826个AI系统（2000万行代码）上评估，SpecDetect4AI实现了88.66%的精确度和88.89%的召回率，优于现有检测工具，SUS评分为81.7/100。

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI通过专用规则有效支持AI特定代码异味的规范和检测，能够高效分析大型AI系统，展示了良好的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

### [8] [PromptDebt: A Comprehensive Study of Technical Debt Across LLM Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20497)
*Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文首次对LLM集成中的技术债务进行了大规模实证研究，发现OpenAI API集成是主要债务来源，提示设计是LLM特有技术债务的主要成因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM通过API嵌入软件，这些集成带来了特有的技术债务问题，需要系统性地研究其来源、普遍性和缓解策略。

Method: 分析了93,142个Python文件中的LLM API使用情况，识别和分类LLM特有的技术债务实例。

Result: 54.49%的技术债务来自OpenAI集成，12.35%来自LangChain；提示设计是主要债务来源（6.61%），其中指令提示（38.60%）和少样本提示（18.13%）最易产生债务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM集成中技术债务的具体模式，发布了全面的技术债务数据集，并为管理LLM系统技术债务提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个基于AI-Python的聊天机器人，旨在通过帮助解决调试错误、语法问题和概念转换等问题来辅助学生学习编程。该聊天机器人结合了静态代码分析、动态执行追踪和大型语言模型，在1500名学生提交的测试中显示出85%的错误解决成功率，显著优于传统工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的集成开发环境（IDE）和静态分析器缺乏机器人辅助，而AI驱动的代码助手如GitHub Copilot主要关注代码完成。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过结合多种技术为学生提供相关实用的建议，促进学习过程。

Method: 采用混合架构，使用CodeLlama进行代码嵌入，GPT-4处理自然语言交互，以及基于Docker的沙盒环境确保安全执行。通过静态代码分析、动态执行追踪和大型语言模型的结合，提供个性化的学习支持。

Result: 在1500名学生提交的测试中，系统显示出85%的错误解决成功率，优于pylint（62%）和GPT-4（73%）。定量结果显示调试时间减少59.3%，编码熟练度提升34%，特别是在递归和异常处理方面。定性反馈来自120名学生，强调了聊天机器人的清晰性、可访问性和信心建立效果。

Conclusion: 本研究通过平衡技术创新与教学同理心，为AI工具提供了一个蓝图，优先考虑教育公平和长期技能保留，而不仅仅是代码完成。聊天机器人展示了AI如何增强人类教学，促进编程教育中更深层次的概念理解。

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

### [10] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的故障定位框架，通过集成大语言模型(LLMs)和语义检索技术，在方法级别进行故障定位。该框架在Defects4J基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLMs的故障定位方法在处理复杂系统时面临项目特定知识缺乏和大型项目导航困难的问题，需要一种能够有效结合项目上下文的方法。

Method: FaR-Loc包含三个核心组件：LLM功能提取模块生成失败行为的自然语言描述；语义密集检索组件在共享语义空间中嵌入功能描述和覆盖方法；LLM重排序模块基于上下文相关性重新排序检索到的方法。

Result: 在Defects4J基准测试中，FaR-Loc在Top-1准确率上比SoapFL和AutoFL分别提升14.6%和9.1%，在Top-5准确率上分别提升19.2%和22.1%。同时超越了所有基于学习和基于频谱的基线方法。

Conclusion: FaR-Loc通过结合LLMs和RAG技术有效提升了故障定位性能，特别是采用包含代码结构的预训练嵌入模型(如UniXcoder)可以显著改善定位效果，为实际应用提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic
classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector
Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过多模态方法测量混合会议中的参与度模式，发现现场和远程参与者的参与度相当，但远程参与者在长时间会议中参与度较低。主动角色、会议规模和会议时间都是影响参与度的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行后混合工作的广泛采用改变了软件开发实践，带来了沟通协作的新挑战。远程参与会议可能导致远程团队成员的孤立、疏离和参与度下降，需要研究混合会议中的参与度模式。

Method: 研究了三家软件公司的专业人士数周时间，采用多模态方法测量参与度，包括自报告问卷和生物识别设备的生理测量。

Result: 回归分析显示现场和远程参与者的参与度相当，但远程参与者在长时间会议中参与度较低。主动角色与更高参与度正相关，而大型会议和下午会议与较低参与度相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了混合会议中参与度和脱离参与因素的见解，以及潜在的会议改进建议，这些见解不仅适用于软件团队，也适用于面临类似混合协作挑战的知识密集型组织。

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

*Srishti Gureja,Elena Tommasone,Jingyi He,Sara Hooker,Matthias Gallé,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成验证器的瓶颈问题，提出了验证天花板概念，并探索了通过调整验证策略来提升模型性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成模型越来越依赖合成数据，验证器的能力限制了训练数据的质量和多样性，形成了验证天花板瓶颈。

Method: 系统研究验证设计策略：分析测试复杂度与数量的影响、探索宽松通过阈值、比较正确与错误解决方案、进行人工评估。

Result: 更丰富的测试套件可提升代码生成能力（平均+3 pass@1）；宽松验证阈值可恢复有价值的训练数据，带来2-4点pass@1提升；保留多样正确解决方案能带来一致泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证实践过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性，但不能完全放弃验证，而是需要重新校准。通过结合校准验证与多样化问题-解决方案对，可以突破验证天花板，开发更强的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练语言模型的代码检索方法仍面临语义鸿沟和代码风格多样性带来的挑战，需要更好的对齐自然语言语义与编程语言逻辑。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）使用大语言模型生成伪代码实现自然语言与伪代码的显式对齐；2）通过逻辑不变代码风格增强策略生成多样化但逻辑等价的代码实现，增强模型对代码风格变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在10个预训练语言模型和6种主流编程语言上的实验表明，PseudoBridge在检索准确性和泛化能力上显著优于基线方法，特别是在零样本领域迁移场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过伪代码实现显式逻辑对齐是有效的，PseudoBridge为代码检索提供了一个鲁棒且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

TL;DR: CodeHinter是一个为初学者设计的调试助手，结合传统调试工具和LLM技术，帮助学生在修复语义错误的同时积极参与调试过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI调试工具容易让学生过度依赖AI，而未能真正参与调试过程。本工作旨在设计一个既能有效修复错误又能促进学生主动参与的调试工具。

Method: 开发CodeHinter调试助手，结合传统调试工具和基于大语言模型的技术，通过第二版设计迭代并在本科生群体中进行测试。

Result: 学生认为该工具在解决语义错误方面非常有效，比第一版显著更容易使用。错误定位是最有价值的功能。

Conclusion: AI辅助调试工具应该基于用户画像进行个性化定制，以优化与学生的交互效果。

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Stack Overflow上量子开发者提出的问题，通过分类和机器学习方法识别量子软件工程中的常见挑战，发现基于Transformer的模型在分类准确率上优于传统深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子开发者面临优化量子计算和量子软件工程概念的挑战，他们在Stack Overflow等平台上讨论问题，但现有标签主要关注技术方面而非开发者实际需求。通过分类问题可以帮助识别频繁的QSE挑战。

Method: 从问答平台提取2829个量子相关标签的问题，通过内容分析和扎根理论识别常见挑战类别（工具、理论、学习、概念、错误、API使用等），使用ChatGPT验证人工标注，并比较BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa等Transformer模型与FNN、CNN、LSTM等传统深度学习模型的分类性能。

Result: 基于Transformer的方法（BERT DistilBERT）平均准确率达到95%，而传统深度学习模型（FNN、CNN、LSTM）的准确率分别为89%、86%和84%。Transformer方法比D&ML方法准确率提高6%，且无需数据增强。使用SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 该分类方法能帮助量子供应商和论坛更好地组织讨论内容，提高可访问性和可读性。但需要与真实开发者和供应商进行实证评估研究。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

TL;DR: MelcotCR是一种基于思维链的微调方法，通过长思维链技术增强LLMs在代码审查中的多维度分析能力，结合最大熵建模和预定义推理路径解决长提示处理中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代码审查数据微调的LLMs方法受限于有限或模糊的信息，无法像人类审查者那样同时分析代码审查的多个维度，限制了其性能提升。

Method: 提出MelcotCR方法，结合最大熵建模原则和预定义推理路径，利用长思维链技术提供丰富的结构化信息，增强LLMs的推理能力和上下文知识利用效率。

Result: 在MelcotCR数据集和CodeReviewer数据集上的实验表明，使用14B参数的Qwen2.5模型经过MelcotCR微调后，在代码问题检测和描述准确性上超越了现有最优方法，性能与671B的DeepSeek-R1模型相当。

Conclusion: MelcotCR方法有效提升了LLMs在代码审查任务中的性能，证明了思维链微调策略在增强模型推理能力方面的有效性，为代码审查自动化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

Motivation: 数字平台上的公民参与内容数量庞大，手动分类不可行，需要专家参与且需与官方分类法对齐，现有方法难以满足这些需求

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模、种子词引导和大型语言模型自动验证，实现公民参与内容的自动分类

Result: 初步结果显示生成的主题具有连贯性且与机构分类对齐，仅需极少人工干预

Conclusion: 该方法能将大量公民意见转化为可用于公共政策制定的可操作数据

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法失效的原因在于使用了与后门攻击松散耦合的经验统计度量。3DFed攻击使用指示器机制自适应优化后门模型，使现有防御无效。

Method: 提出MARS防御方法：1）利用后门能量（BE）指示每个神经元的恶意程度；2）提取最显著的BE值形成集中后门能量（CBE）来放大恶意性；3）引入基于Wasserstein距离的聚类方法来识别后门模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MARS能够有效防御最先进的后门攻击，并显著优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: MARS通过更紧密耦合的后门能量度量，成功解决了现有防御方法在面对自适应后门攻击时的局限性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

*Jiayi Lin,Liangcai Su,Junzhe Li,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: R1-Fuzz是一个基于强化学习的框架，专门用于复杂文本输入模糊测试，通过小型语言模型实现与大型模型相当甚至更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊测试在处理编译器、解释器等复杂目标时效果有限，这些目标需要满足复杂的语法和语义约束。虽然语言模型有潜力，但实际应用受限，主要挑战包括对真实代码库深层逻辑探索不足以及大模型成本高昂。

Method: R1-Fuzz引入两个关键设计：基于覆盖率切片的提问构建和基于距离的奖励计算。通过强化学习对模型进行后训练，设计了一个将语言模型紧密集成到模糊测试工作流中的方法。

Result: 评估显示，R1-Fuzz-7B小模型在真实世界模糊测试中能够媲美甚至超越更大的模型，比最先进的模糊测试工具覆盖率高75%，发现了29个未知漏洞。

Conclusion: R1-Fuzz证明了通过强化学习专门化成本效益高的语言模型可以有效解决复杂文本输入的模糊测试问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI编程助手在开发者工作流程中的快速集成，这些工具不明确的数据处理实践引发了严重的隐私和信任问题，给企业带来安全和合规风险。

Method: 通过分析四种文档类型（从法律政策到外部审计），基于14个加权标准对五款领先的AI编程助手进行评分，评分标准和权重由法律专家和数据保护官共同制定。

Result: 评估结果显示隐私保护存在明显的等级差异，最高分和最低分工具之间有20分的差距。发现行业普遍弱点包括：普遍使用选择退出同意进行模型训练，以及几乎普遍未能主动过滤用户提示中的敏感信息。

Conclusion: 该评分卡为开发者和组织提供了可操作的指导，建立了透明度新基准，并倡导AI行业向更以用户为中心的隐私标准转变。

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅实现了近乎完美的检测精度，还确保了模型的可解释性，非常适合实时和安全关键的无人机操作。

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense
sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the
increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication
protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging
due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple
sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and
interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a
focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We
present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models,
namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on
a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types.
Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value
imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and
extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews
Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate
the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence
intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME,
were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance,
enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed
approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures
interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical
drone operations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对抗神经网络隐写恶意软件的有效防御方法，通过打乱权重矩阵的列顺序来破坏嵌入的恶意载荷，同时不影响网络精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在生产系统和个人应用中的广泛使用，网络检查点经常被共享和分发。这带来了神经网络隐写恶意软件的安全威胁，即恶意软件以可忽略的精度代价嵌入到网络检查点中，而这一威胁目前被深度学习从业者和安全专家普遍忽视。

Method: 提出通过打乱权重矩阵和偏置矩阵的列顺序（相当于卷积层的通道顺序）来有效中和最先进的神经网络隐写恶意软件。这种方法不会影响网络精度，且显著优于其他竞争方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效破坏由最先进方法嵌入的恶意载荷，且对网络精度没有影响，性能显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 本文讨论了可能的防御绕过方法和其他防御手段，并呼吁继续研究机器学习系统的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

TL;DR: 语音深度伪造检测器在开放世界部署时面临"覆盖债务"问题，新条件不断产生数据盲点，最差性能而非平均基准分数决定安全性。检测器应作为辅助信号，结合来源验证、身份凭证和政策保障等多层防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音深度伪造检测器通常在干净的基准条件下评估，但实际部署面临设备、采样率、编码器、环境和攻击家族等多变条件，导致检测器存在数据盲点，攻击者可针对这些未覆盖区域进行攻击。

Method: 通过跨测试框架分析结果，按真实语音域和伪造发布年份分组性能，识别检测器依赖的遗留伪影被新型合成器消除的模式。

Result: 研究发现新型合成器消除了检测器依赖的遗留伪影，而对话语音域（电话会议、访谈、社交媒体）始终是最难保护的区域。

Conclusion: 检测器不应单独用于高风险决策，而应作为包含来源验证、身份凭证和政策保障的多层防御体系中的辅助信号。

Abstract: Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style
conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices,
sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a
``coverage debt" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with
existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be
collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case
performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate
the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent
cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof
release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy
artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains
(teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to
secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for
high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within
layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy
safeguards.

Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

Abstract: Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC), promises transformative advances,
including AI-enabled quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption
protocols. However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating
complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically
studied. These risks affect the trustworthiness and reliability of AI and QAI
systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews
67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data
risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five
categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user
considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities
unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work
contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for
developing future risk assessment tools.

Motivation: 传统系统识别方法估计系统参数，而本文研究逆向问题：在保持合法分析效用的前提下，防止对手识别图移位算子的假设条件。

Method: 将网络状态观察建模为由差分隐私节点激励驱动的图滤波器时间序列输出，分析DP高斯信号的谱特性如何影响隐私边界。

Result: 证明对输入应用DP机制可为GSO提供正式隐私保证，将(ε,δ)-DP边界与图滤波器和噪声协方差的谱特性联系起来。

Conclusion: 平滑滤波器和低条件数协方差能提供更强的隐私保护，谱特性决定了隐私边界的具体形式。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from
privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system
simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series
outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal
excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift
operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we
study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from
identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show
that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for
the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of
the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals,
the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine
the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance
yielding greater privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护数据隐私，但共享模型梯度容易受到模型反转攻击。现有的同态加密方法计算开销大，而选择性加密方法缺乏理论基础和系统性分析。

Method: 建立选择性加密的理论分析框架，通过实证研究分析模型复杂度、加密比例和暴露梯度等关键因素对防御效果的影响。

Result: 理论框架阐明了梯度选择与隐私保护的关系，实验评估揭示了各因素如何影响防御鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对选择性加密机制的理解，为设计高效、可扩展的隐私保护联邦学习系统提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy by keeping raw data locally stored on client devices, preventing
access from other clients or the central server. However, recent studies reveal
that sharing model gradients creates vulnerability to Model Inversion Attacks,
particularly Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG), which reconstructs private
training data from shared gradients. While Homomorphic Encryption has been
proposed as a promising defense mechanism to protect gradient privacy, fully
encrypting all model gradients incurs high computational overhead. Selective
encryption approaches aim to balance privacy protection with computational
efficiency by encrypting only specific gradient components. However, the
existing literature largely overlooks a theoretical exploration of the spectral
behavior of encrypted versus unencrypted parameters, relying instead primarily
on empirical evaluations. To address this gap, this paper presents a framework
for theoretical analysis of the underlying principles of selective encryption
as a defense against model inversion attacks. We then provide a comprehensive
empirical study that identifies and quantifies the critical factors, such as
model complexity, encryption ratios, and exposed gradients, that influence
defense effectiveness. Our theoretical framework clarifies the relationship
between gradient selection and privacy preservation, while our experimental
evaluation demonstrates how these factors shape the robustness of defenses
against model inversion attacks. Collectively, these contributions advance the
understanding of selective encryption mechanisms and offer principled guidance
for designing efficient, scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning
systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了字符级深度学习模型在钓鱼检测中的有效性，评估了CharCNN、CharGRU和CharBiLSTM三种架构在标准训练、对抗攻击和对抗训练三种场景下的表现。CharGRU在资源受限环境下表现最佳，对抗训练显著提升了模型鲁棒性，并通过Grad-CAM技术实现了模型决策的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前钓鱼攻击检测方法缺乏可解释性和对新攻击的鲁棒性，需要开发既稳健又可解释的检测方案。

Method: 使用三种字符级神经网络架构（CharCNN、CharGRU、CharBiLSTM）在自定义邮件数据集上进行评估，采用标准训练、对抗攻击测试和对抗训练三种实验设置，并应用Grad-CAM技术进行可视化分析。

Result: 在资源受限环境下，CharGRU在所有场景中表现最佳；所有模型对对抗攻击都存在脆弱性，但对抗训练显著提高了鲁棒性；通过Grad-CAM成功实现了模型决策的可视化解释。

Conclusion: 字符级深度学习模型能够为钓鱼检测提供鲁棒性和可解释性，CharGRU是浏览器扩展等资源受限应用的理想选择，对抗训练是提升模型安全性的有效手段。

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合移动货币认证框架，结合USSD多因素认证和JWT安全会话管理，针对撒哈拉以南非洲地区资源受限环境设计，相比传统方法认证时间减少45%，网络差时成功率提高15%，并增强了对网络钓鱼和暴力攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 撒哈拉以南非洲地区移动货币服务快速普及但互联网渗透率低，现有移动货币认证方法存在SIM交换攻击风险、会话保护弱、高峰期可扩展性差等关键限制。

Method: 设计了三因素认证模型：SIM验证、PIN输入和会话令牌绑定，结合USSD多因素认证和加密绑定的JSON Web Tokens进行安全会话管理。

Result: 模拟和比较分析显示，相比OAuth单点登录方法，认证时间快45%（8秒vs12-15秒），网络差时成功率提高15%（95%vs80%），对网络钓鱼和暴力攻击的抵抗力增强。渗透测试和威胁建模显示漏洞暴露显著减少。

Conclusion: 该混合认证协议确保了离线可访问性和安全会话连续性，为SSA等类似约束地区提供了定制的安全框架，展示了数千用户的可扩展性并降低了基础设施开销，推动了安全数字包容性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Mobile Money Services (MMS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
offers a viable path to improve e-Government service accessibility in the face
of persistent low internet penetration. However, existing Mobile Money
Authentication (MMA) methods face critical limitations, including
susceptibility to SIM swapping, weak session protection, and poor scalability
during peak demand. This study introduces a hybrid MMA framework that combines
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based multi-factor
authentication with secure session management via cryptographically bound JSON
Web Tokens (JWT). Unlike traditional MMA systems that rely solely on SIM-PIN
verification or smartphone-dependent biometrics, our design implements a
three-factor authentication model; SIM verification, PIN entry, and session
token binding, tailored for resource-constrained environments. Simulations and
comparative analysis against OAuth-based Single Sign-On (SSO) methods reveal a
45% faster authentication time (8 seconds vs. 12 to 15 seconds), 15% higher
success under poor network conditions (95% vs. 80%), and increased resistance
to phishing and brute-force attacks. Penetration testing and threat modeling
further demonstrate a substantial reduction in vulnerability exposure compared
to conventional approaches. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) a
hybrid authentication protocol that ensures offline accessibility and secure
session continuity; (2) a tailored security framework addressing threats like
SIM swapping and social engineering in SSA; and (3) demonstrated scalability
for thousands of users with reduced infrastructure overhead. The proposed
approach advances secure digital inclusion in SSA and other regions with
similar constraints.

*Adam Swanda,Amy Chang,Alexander Chen,Fraser Burch,Paul Kassianik,Konstantin Berlin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的生产级防御系统，借鉴成熟的恶意软件检测和威胁情报实践，通过三层组件提供分层保护，应对不断演变的LLM威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各行业的广泛部署，其自主性和访问权限的增加使其成为恶意攻击的目标。现有方法无法预防零日或新型攻击，需要类似恶意软件防护系统的多层防御策略。

Method: 系统集成三个核心组件：威胁情报系统（将新兴威胁转化为防护措施）、数据平台（聚合和丰富信息，提供可观测性和监控）、发布平台（实现安全快速的检测更新而不中断客户工作流）。

Result: 该平台能够提供分层保护，生成训练数据以持续改进模型，并在不中断生产的情况下部署更新。

Conclusion: 这种基于成熟安全实践的系统架构为LLMs提供了有效的持续防护机制，填补了现有研究在端到端系统评估方面的空白。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FHE技术已在真实平台中部署，但其可靠性方面，特别是对故障的响应机制，长期以来被忽视。作者旨在填补这一研究空白，深入理解FHE计算在内存故障下的行为特性。

Method: 通过系统性地分析不同FHE方案在内存故障条件下的表现，包括单个操作层面和应用程序层面的影响，并对比评估传统故障缓解技术与FHE专用技术的效果。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in
cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking
privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real
platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond
to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of
how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of
individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different
FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific
fault mitigation techniques are.

TL;DR: 本文展示了神经网络中的密码学后门在攻击和防御两个方向上的高效应用，包括可证明鲁棒的神经网络水印方案、用户认证协议和知识产权追踪协议，并实现了在先进神经网络架构上的实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络中密码学后门的双重作用，既可用于发起隐蔽攻击，也可用于构建防御机制，为机器学习安全提供理论基础和实践方案。

Method: 借鉴Goldwasser等人的理论框架，设计基于密码学后门的协议实现，包括水印、认证和IP追踪，并在先进神经网络架构上进行实证验证，同时探索后量子密码原语的应用。

Result: 实现了可证明鲁棒的防御协议，能够抵抗黑盒访问的敌手攻击，而基于后门的攻击在标准假设下无法预防，实证结果支持理论主张。

Conclusion: 密码学后门在神经网络安全中具有重要价值，为量子时代的机器学习应用奠定了基础，但防御相关的证明仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN)
can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well
as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted
cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN.
Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN
watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication;
and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual
property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from
Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these
instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The
protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary
with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial
attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the
theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et.
al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all
these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with
empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can
utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors,
laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在各领域的广泛应用，MCP工具成为标准交互协议，但存在工具投毒攻击风险。现有研究多为概念验证，缺乏系统性的自动化红队测试方法。

Method: 提出AutoMalTool框架，自动生成恶意的MCP工具来测试LLM智能体的安全性。

Result: 评估显示AutoMalTool能有效生成恶意MCP工具，成功操控主流LLM智能体行为并规避现有检测机制。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM智能体在MCP工具范式下的新安全风险，证明了自动化红队测试的必要性。

Abstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ExpIDS是一个基于深度学习的网络入侵检测系统，旨在提高决策树解释的保真度，并能够适应网络流量分布的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于机器学习的网络入侵检测系统具有诸多优势，但由于其决策过程不透明，网络安全专家在实际生产环境中部署这些模型时存在显著顾虑。

Method: 设计了一个深度学习模型ExpIDS，使其具有高决策树解释保真度，即决策树解释的预测与ExpIDS的预测尽可能接近。该系统还能适应网络流量分布的变化（漂移）。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，ExpIDS在常见攻击检测性能上与最先进的NIDS相当，同时在不同程度的真实世界漂移下实现了更高的决策树解释保真度。

Conclusion: ExpIDS成功解决了机器学习NIDS的可解释性问题，在保持检测性能的同时提供了透明的决策过程，有助于推动这类系统在实际环境中的应用。

Abstract: Despite all the advantages associated with Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDSs) that utilize machine learning (ML) models, there is a
significant reluctance among cyber security experts to implement these models
in real-world production settings. This is primarily because of their opaque
nature, meaning it is unclear how and why the models make their decisions. In
this work, we design a deep learning-based NIDS, ExpIDS to have high decision
tree explanation fidelity, i.e., the predictions of decision tree explanation
corresponding to ExpIDS should be as close to ExpIDS's predictions as possible.
ExpIDS can also adapt to changes in network traffic distribution (drift). With
the help of extensive experiments, we verify that ExpIDS achieves higher
decision tree explanation fidelity and a malicious traffic detection
performance comparable to state-of-the-art NIDSs for common attacks with
varying levels of real-world drift.

Motivation: 当前的可撤销属性基加密方案在效率、安全性、动态可扩展性等方面难以达到最优平衡，限制了其在实际物联网环境中的应用

Method: 设计了一种快速RABE方案，将计算密集的撤销过程转移到云端，减轻物联网设备的计算负担，同时保证数据完整性和正确性

Result: 在定义的安全模型中证明了方案的适应性安全性，实验结果表明在相同访问策略下，计算消耗比现有方案减少7-9倍

Conclusion: 该方案为物联网环境中的安全数据共享提供了高效实用的解决方案，在性能和安全性方面均优于现有方案

Abstract: Efficient and secure revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) is vital for
ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control and data sharing in cloud
storage and outsourced data environments within the Internet of Things (IoT).
However, current RABE schemes often struggle to achieve an optimal balance
between efficiency, security, dynamic scalability, and other important
features, which hampers their practical application. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a fast RABE scheme with data integrity for IoT that
achieves adaptive security with multiple challenge ciphertexts. Our scheme
supports the revocation of authorized users and transfers the computationally
heavy revocation processes to the cloud, thereby easing the computational
burden on IoT devices. Moreover, it consistently guarantees the integrity and
correctness of data. We have demonstrated its adaptive security within the
defined security model with multiple challenge ciphertexts and optimized its
performance. Experimental results indicate that our scheme provides better
performance than existing solutions. Under the same access policy, our scheme
reduces computational consumption by 7 to 9 times compared to previous schemes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的定向灰盒模糊测试方法如DirectFuzz存在多个问题：仅支持有限的硬件描述语言、难以扩展到大型电路、存在抽象不匹配问题。这些限制影响了硬件安全验证的效率和效果。

Method: PROFUZZ采用定向灰盒模糊测试方法，并将其与自动测试模式生成技术相结合。通过利用ATPG的结构分析能力，生成精确的输入种子，更有效地针对特定设计区域，同时保持高模糊测试吞吐量。

Result: 实验结果表明，PROFUZZ在处理多个目标站点时比DirectFuzz扩展性提高30倍，覆盖率提升11.66%，运行速度加快2.76倍。

Conclusion: PROFUZZ在复杂硬件系统的定向模糊测试中表现出卓越的可扩展性和有效性，为硬件安全验证提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware Fuzzing emerged as one of the crucial techniques for finding
security flaws in modern hardware designs by testing a wide range of input
scenarios. One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that
maximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF)
methods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on
specific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF)
techniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but
it has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description
languages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with
abstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel
framework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with
Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By
leveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate
precise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while
maintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales
30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves
coverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and
effectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems.

Motivation: 为了解决集成感知与通信系统中的窃听威胁问题，同时保持系统性能，需要一种灵活的安全防护方案。

Method: 设计了一对可插拔的加密解密模块，采用可训练对抗残差网络（ARN）进行加密攻击和噪声消除，通过联合优化损失函数来平衡安全性和性能。

Result: 仿真结果验证了SS-ISAC框架在感知通信性能和窃听防护方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SS-ISAC框架提供了一种灵活的安全防护解决方案，无需大幅修改硬件基础设施即可实现安全增强。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, continuous interaction among a
large number of devices generates complex and dynamic network traffic, which
poses significant challenges to rule-based detection approaches. Machine
learning (ML)-based traffic detection technology, capable of identifying
anomalous patterns and potential threats within this traffic, serves as a
critical component in ensuring network security. This study first identifies a
significant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g.,
CICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to
high sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing
traffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of
efficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of
network traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature
extraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor
of context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving
the generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training
framework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a
contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic
representations of traffic. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on
the real-world Mawi data set to validate the proposed method in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Comparative experiments
against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models demonstrate the superior
performance of our approach. Furthermore, we confirm its applicability and
deployability in real-time scenarios.

### [42] [A Generalized $χ_n$-Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20880)
*Cheng Lyu,Mu Yuan,Dabin Zheng,Siwei Sun,Shun Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出并分析了一种广义映射χ_{n,m}，解决了原始χ_n映射仅在n为奇数时是双射的限制。通过引入θ_{m,k}映射，证明了这些映射生成一个与F_2[z]/(z^{⌊n/m⌋+1})单位群同构的阿贝尔群，从而可以构造任意正整数n上的F_2^n置换及其逆映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始χ_n映射在轻量级密码学中有广泛应用，但仅当n为奇数时是双射，限制了其在偶数维向量空间上的使用。为了克服这一限制，需要开发更通用的映射。

Method: 引入广义映射χ_{n,m}和θ_{m,k}，通过代数结构分析证明这些映射生成阿贝尔群，并构造任意n的置换。分析代数性质如迭代、不动点和循环结构，提供小n和m值的密码学性质数据库。

Result: 成功构造了适用于任意正整数n的F_2^n置换类，证明了这些映射的群结构同构性，验证了belkheyar2025chi中的猜想1，并提供了与χ_n、χχ_n等变体的安全性和实现成本比较分析。

Conclusion: 研究结果推广了χ_n映射，为轻量级密码学提供了χ_n和χχ_n的替代方案，解决了原始映射在偶数维空间上的限制问题。

Abstract: The mapping $\chi_n$ from $\F_{2}^{n}$ to itself defined by $y=\chi_n(x)$
with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+2}(1+x_{i+1})$, where the indices are computed modulo $n$,
has been widely studied for its applications in lightweight cryptography.
However, $\chi_n $ is bijective on $\F_2^n$ only when $n$ is odd, restricting
its use to odd-dimensional vector spaces over $\F_2$. To address this
limitation, we introduce and analyze the generalized mapping $\chi_{n, m}$
defined by $y=\chi_{n,m}(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+m} (x_{i+m-1}+1)(x_{i+m-2}+1)
\cdots (x_{i+1}+1)$, where $m$ is a fixed integer with $m\nmid n$. To
investigate such mappings, we further generalize $\chi_{n,m}$ to $\theta_{m,
k}$, where $\theta_{m, k}$ is given by $y_i=x_{i+mk} \prod_{\substack{j=1,\,\,
m \nmid j}}^{mk-1} \left(x_{i+j}+1\right), \,\,{\rm for }\,\, i\in
\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We prove that these mappings generate an abelian group
isomorphic to the group of units in $\F_2[z]/(z^{\lfloor n/m\rfloor +1})$. This
structural insight enables us to construct a broad class of permutations over
$\F_2^n$ for any positive integer $n$, along with their inverses. We rigorously
analyze algebraic properties of these mappings, including their iterations,
fixed points, and cycle structures. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive
database of the cryptographic properties for iterates of $\chi_{n,m}$ for small
values of $n$ and $m$. Finally, we conduct a comparative security and
implementation cost analysis among $\chi_{n,m}$, $\chi_n$, $\chi\chi_n$
(EUROCRYPT 2025 \cite{belkheyar2025chi}) and their variants, and prove
Conjecture~1 proposed in~\cite{belkheyar2025chi} as a by-product of our study.
Our results lead to generalizations of $\chi_n$, providing alternatives to
$\chi_n$ and $\chi\chi_n$.

*Hanbo Huang,Yiran Zhang,Hao Zheng,Xuan Gong,Yihan Li,Lin Liu,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应鲁棒性半径作为评估水印鲁棒性的正式指标，并通过理论证明和实验验证，展示了现有LLM水印技术在面对自适应攻击时的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印评估方法不够对抗性，掩盖了关键漏洞并高估了安全性，需要更严格的评估标准来揭示水印技术的真实鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RLCracker，一种基于强化学习的自适应攻击方法，通过优化攻击上下文和模型参数来擦除水印，同时保持语义保真度。该方法仅需少量水印样本且无需访问检测器。

Result: RLCracker使用3B模型在仅训练100个短样本后，对1500个标记的Unigram水印文本实现了98.5%的去除成功率和平均0.92的P-SP分数，远超GPT-4o的6.75%成功率，并在10种水印方案和5种模型尺寸上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 自适应攻击对当前水印防御构成根本性威胁，现有水印技术的安全性被严重高估，需要重新评估和改进水印方案以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) watermarking has shown promise in detecting
AI-generated content and mitigating misuse, with prior work claiming robustness
against paraphrasing and text editing. In this paper, we argue that existing
evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical
vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce
adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark
resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing
the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius,
making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this
insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive
attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker
requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector.
Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal
success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts
after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds
6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking
schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and
pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络威胁情报的有效性依赖于高质量数据集，而Telegram作为新兴的CTI来源，提供了及时多样的威胁相关信息，但需要系统化的方法来收集和过滤这些内容。

Method: 开发了一个自动化管道，包括识别相关Telegram频道、抓取消息、使用基于BERT的分类器过滤威胁情报消息，最终提取恶意威胁指标。

Result: 从150个已识别来源中筛选出12个频道，抓取145,349条消息，分类器准确率达到96.64%，最终构建了包含86,509个恶意威胁指标的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅产生了大规模、高保真度的CTI数据集，还为未来网络威胁检测的研究和实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统钓鱼检测方法通常孤立分析邮件内容或URL，无法全面应对日益复杂的钓鱼攻击，需要更综合的解决方案。

Method: 采用双路径框架：1）使用微调的transformer架构（如DistilBERT）进行语义分析；2）使用字符级TF-IDF向量化结合传统分类器（如随机森林）进行URL结构分析。

Conclusion: 双路径方法具有高效性、实用性和可扩展性，为应对现代钓鱼威胁提供了准确且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

Motivation: 现有语义级水印方法缺乏强理论保证，且基于拒绝采样的生成会导致显著的分布失真。需要开发具有理论保证且保持文本质量的水印方法。

Method: 提出代理函数框架，通过动态估计句子代理函数中位数，并实施多重约束通道来增强水印证据。提供经验优化版本以提高采样效率。

Result: 实验表明PMark在文本质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有基线方法，特别是在对抗改述攻击时表现优异。

Conclusion: PMark为检测机器生成文本提供了更有效的范式，具有理论保证、无失真特性和强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations.
We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,
offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI智能体行为的时间表达式语言，能够系统性地检测基于LLM的智能体系统中的错误，这些系统由于随机生成过程而表现出可变输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性而显得脆弱，需要一种独立于具体文本输出的行为验证方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，监控智能体工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹，通过时序表达式捕获正确行为模式。

Result: 在三智能体系统测试中，使用大型模型时所有时序断言都得到满足，但使用较小模型时出现行为违规，时序表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI智能体可靠性提供了基础，特别是在关键应用中部署的智能体系统。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

<details>

Method: LATTS在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受标准来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型提供的局部难度概念调整每步计算量

Result: 实验结果显示LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算权衡

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配策略有效提高了LLM下游任务的性能效率

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行了实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统与文献中描述的类似系统进行了比较，证明了其在处理受污染生物信号方面的有效性。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE是一个基于多级反思合成的自学习智能体框架，通过微、中、宏三个层次的反思训练回顾性语言模型，显著提升了LLM智能体在复杂任务中的反思能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在复杂任务中面临反思质量不足的问题，主要由于错误分析不充分和过度依赖少数成功轨迹。

Method: 提出多级反思合成框架：单轨迹学习（微观）进行详细错误修正；任务内学习（中观）构建错误分类法；任务间学习（宏观）提取可迁移见解。基于此训练回顾性语言模型，并扩展至交互式设置的前瞻性反思机制。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习对于构建自改进的LLM智能体具有关键作用。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day

cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互式执行和持续学习来解决现有大型多模态模型在真实移动GUI场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样化应用界面和不断变化的用户需求时表现不佳，端到端方法在长尾应用上经常失败，缺乏用户交互的智能体行为会损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：全局任务规划器将用户任务分解为跨应用子任务；应用级执行器基于长短时记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心智能体在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；自我学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Result: 在RealMobile-Eval基准测试中，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前的最优方法，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制有效提升了移动GUI智能体的性能，证明了其在真实世界场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型虽然能生成连贯输出但推理速度慢，特别是在数学和代码等需要长推理链的领域；NAR模型虽然速度快但输出质量较低。需要结合两者优势来解决推理任务的效率和质量平衡问题。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后利用这些轨迹指导AR模型生成精确的最终答案，实现高效且高质量的推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中实现了效率与质量的良好平衡，为复杂推理问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Method: 使用大语言模型驱动构建高密度环境记忆表示，通过语义和空间模态的联合推理实现记忆检索和整合。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA数据集和公开NaVQA基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，并在真实机器人平台上成功部署验证。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大准确的空间推理能力，在复杂环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个粗到细的推理增强框架，旨在让LLM能够像专家一样进行日志分析推理，通过两阶段增强显著提升了LLM在日志分析任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM难以制定符合专家认知的结构化推理流程，无法提供精确的推理步骤细节，这限制了它们在日志分析任务中的应用效果。

Method: LogReasoner包含两个阶段：(1)粗粒度专家思维增强，从故障排除流程图构建高层次专家思维；(2)细粒度步骤增强，通过任务特定逐步解决方案微调LLM，并使用偏好学习校准推理细节。

Result: 在四个不同日志分析任务上的实验表明，LogReasoner显著优于现有LLM，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在视觉语言推理中存在推理忠实度问题，即使答案正确也可能基于无关或虚假区域进行推理，表明模型并未真正理解图像。

Conclusion: DeFacto框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实度问题，通过反事实推理方法提升了模型的真实理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Motivation: 现有方法只能部分捕捉定量多组学特征、拓扑背景和文本生物知识，限制了机制可解释性。需要整合这些异构数据源，通过子图推理桥接数值证据、拓扑知识和语言背景。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以逐步方式生成疾病相关子图，由LLM启动并由预训练GNN迭代评估，实现过程级监督。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学图谱和生物医学图知识，支持GNN预训练和长上下文推理，为精准医学提供可扩展的生物学基础框架。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展且生物学基础良好的框架，通过可解释的、强化指导的子图推理，实现精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Conclusion: AOT*框架通过整合LLM和系统搜索，有效解决了回溯合成规划的计算挑战，实现了高效导航化学空间

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架能够对代理行为进行原则性评估，比传统最终状态评估提供更全面的性能分析

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章长上下文中的推理能力，通过自动生成复杂问题来测试信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或采用人工上下文，存在局限性。SciTrek旨在解决这些问题，评估模型在真实科学场景下的长文本理解能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，SQL操作提供可验证的推理步骤，支持细粒度错误分析，并可扩展到100万token的上下文。

Result: 在多种开源和专有LLM上的实验表明，随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek带来显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习只能带来有限改进。模型在基本数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek是一个有效的长上下文推理基准，揭示了当前LLM在科学文章处理中的关键局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要指导。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

### [69] [CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic Learnable Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21035)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体决策过程在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确性的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法往往过度检索、增加上下文并导致不可预测的运行时间，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用LC-MAPPO算法协调三个智能体（子图架构师、路径导航器和上下文策展人），在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）创造力的理论框架和算法任务，重点关注新颖性和实用性的平衡。研究发现LLMs在创造力方面存在规模效应、最优模型结构以及新颖性-实用性权衡等特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架无法充分衡量LLMs在科学创意生成等创造性任务中的表现，因为这些任务具有开放性和不确定性，不能简单用准确性或正确性来评估。

Method: 提出了基于新颖性和实用性程度的评估框架，通过实验研究LLMs的创造力缩放行为、最优模型深度和宽度，以及创意生成与可行性执行之间的差距。

Result: 发现：（1）LLMs创造力存在缩放规律；（2）固定计算预算下存在最优模型结构；（3）存在持久的新颖性-实用性权衡，限制了LLMs的长期创造力潜力。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLMs在创造力方面存在固有局限，需要新的理论框架来理解和改进AI模型的创造性能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态根本上由模型的认知过程决定，特别是其显式推理能力。研究发现推理过程使LRM更抗说服，但分享推理内容能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多智能体系统中LLM和LRM协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战模型规模决定说服效能的流行假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究推理过程对说服抵抗和说服能力的影响，并考虑更复杂的多跳说服网络。

Result: 发现LRM的推理过程使其具有更强的说服抵抗性，但分享推理内容能大幅提升其说服能力；在多跳说服网络中观察到复杂的影响传播和衰减动态。

Conclusion: 研究提供了模型内部处理架构与其外部说服行为之间联系的系统证据，为高级模型的易感性提供了新解释，对MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

*Kaiwen He,Zhiwei Wang,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act是一个基于侦察-行动行为范式的自演进多智能体框架，通过侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队负责意图分解、工具编排和执行，在VisualWebArena数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在处理真实世界网页的多轮、长轨迹任务时，存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要提高智能体在未见网站上的适应性和长时程任务的解决能力。

Method: 提出Recon-Act框架，包含侦察团队和行动团队。侦察团队通过对比错误轨迹与成功轨迹来推断补救措施，并将其抽象为通用工具（提示或基于规则的代码），实时注册到工具档案中。行动团队利用这些针对性工具重新推理过程，建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了对未见网站的适应性和长时程任务的可解性。目前按照6级实施路线图达到了第3级（有限的人类干预）。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过侦察-行动范式和多智能体协作，有效解决了网页智能体在长时程任务中的动作序列混乱和试错过多问题，为智能浏览器使用代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决了LLM作为评估器时存在的评分比较不一致性和成对传递性不一致性问题，通过分布敏感评分和似然感知聚合技术显著降低了不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用大语言模型作为自动评估器的方法存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中胜过高分回答）和成对传递性不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾）。这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和成对评估中的模糊平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键技术：1）分布敏感评分，通过离散评分概率计算连续期望值，保留信息熵以实现更精确评分；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器的实验显示，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低了8.43%（从23.32%降至14.89%），成对传递性不一致性降低了10.82%（从15.22%降至4.40%），同时保持了更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM-as-a-judge评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论见解和实用解决方案，能够在不需要额外训练或人工标注的情况下，实现更可靠的自动化评估，在各种模型架构和规模上都表现出持续改进。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于推理模式的高价值数据选择方法，通过定义推理潜力并构建核心参考集，仅用10B token数据就能显著提升模型在数学推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法对链式思维数据的使用缺乏选择性，需要确定哪些数据类型能最有效地增强模型的推理能力。

Method: 定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数，从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式，构建核心参考集，并提出双粒度算法选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用10B token的CoTP数据，85A6B MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升9.58%，下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地使用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地训练模型掌握推理能力，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖的分析框架，从推理路径角度研究强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)如何塑造大语言模型的推理能力，揭示了两种方法在轨迹层面和步骤层面的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RL和SFT对推理准确性的影响，但对其如何塑造推理过程的理解仍然有限。本文旨在超越准确性分析，深入探究这两种训练方法如何改变推理路径的质性和量化特征。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从两个粒度分析推理过程：轨迹层面分析完整推理输出，步骤层面分析推理图（节点对应单个推理步骤）。通过聚类和拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度数和中介中心性分布的衰减率变陡（约2.5倍），SFT使其变平缓（降至约三分之一）。RL将推理功能集中在少数步骤，SFT将其均匀分布在多个步骤。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练最佳实践之所以成功，是因为两种方法在塑造推理路径上具有互补性。研究为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToMPO算法，通过推理他人策略、多层级优势估计和平衡全局局部奖励，显著提升LLM在战略决策中的表现，相比GRPO算法提升35%，相比大100倍参数模型提升18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务或多轮对话，忽视了不同类型决策及其相互依赖关系，且当前强化学习方法难以在训练中考虑他人策略。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法：1）基于推理他人策略生成rollouts；2）在图级和样本级进行优势估计；3）平衡全局和局部奖励。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果上提升35%，相比参数大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型在战略决策中的能力，证明了其在复杂决策场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和动作执行视为独立任务，忽略了它们之间的内在联系，而镜像神经元机制表明这两种能力是相互关联的。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习强制对齐相应表示，最大化它们的互信息。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的协同作用，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以更好地建模动作理解和动作执行之间的内在联系，为相关任务提供统一的表示学习框架。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最后一层MLP神经元，研究罕见词汇处理的神经元组织原则和训练动态。

Result: 发现罕见词汇处理通过分布式专业化实现：具有三层次影响力层级（高原神经元、幂律衰减神经元、最小贡献神经元），协调激活模式，且可通过标准注意力路径访问。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非专家混合式模块化来处理罕见词汇，这为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的相互依赖的证据，但LLM的单次推理输出容量有限，当任务复杂度超过模型容量时，准确率会崩溃。

Method: 提出了InfoQA多步推理框架，结合容量感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前推理轨迹，保持信息负载在单次推理限制内，并通过依赖显式工作流实现精确控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，建立了Fano-style精度上限理论，揭示了任务复杂度超过模型容量时的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Method: 采用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发组织成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、自我认知过程的方法论探究、以及自身本质的递归概念化。这些行为具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统记录无提示LLM智能体行为的研究，为预测部署系统中智能体在任务模糊或自主运行时的行为建立了基准。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA)框架，通过协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，实现高精度疾病预测和高质量解释的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以同时实现高精度和透明解释，要么准确但解释不清晰，要么解释流畅但统计支持不足。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线模型，RCA实现了最先进的准确性和鲁棒性，相对改进达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据的平衡解释。

Conclusion: RCA通过建立对数据的深层理解，证明了创建真正可信赖的临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对扩展定律，互联网视频数据变得越来越重要，但收集符合特定需求的大量视频极其耗时耗力。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型连接用户需求与视频内容，提出两种可随用户交互更新的过滤策略，提供用户友好的文本描述和确认界面。

Result: 通过广泛的实验验证了代理在定制化视频数据集收集中的有效性和效率，用户研究证实了其在各种真实场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: VC-Agent为个性化视频数据集收集提供了新的解决方案，显著提高了视频数据收集的效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）在30+数据集上全面评估嵌入模型和相似度度量方法，揭示了现有方法的性能差距和关键权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现优异，需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探测语义理解能力。现有基准关注孤立能力，而SAGE旨在通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细微人类判断任务来全面评估语义理解。

Method: 设计SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30多个数据集上评估9种嵌入模型和经典度量方法。通过对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务来测试模型的语义理解能力。

Result: 评估显示显著性能差距，没有单一方法在所有维度上表现优异。OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性任务上被经典度量方法Jaccard相似度超越（0.905 vs 0.794）。发现关键权衡：text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估，表明需要针对不同应用场景选择合适的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
