*Anderson de Lima Luiz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: WARP是一个利用大语言模型和动态网络增强合成的系统，用于实时解决编译错误，通过监控开发终端、检测错误，并整合微调代码LLM的理解与网络资源中的解决方案，显著提高修复率和语义正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译错误是软件开发生产力的主要瓶颈，需要一种能够实时、准确解决这些错误的方法，以提升开发效率。

Method: WARP系统主动监控开发终端，智能检测编译错误，并将微调的代码LLM的理解与从开发者论坛和官方文档等最新网络资源中检索到的相关解决方案、解释和代码片段相结合。

Result: 在CGP基准测试（包含C/C++、Python和Go错误）上，WARP实现了72.5%的正确编译修复率，语义正确性也高于基线LLM方法和传统IDE快速修复。

Conclusion: WARP通过结合LLM和动态网络增强合成，有效解决了编译错误，关键技术挑战在于从噪声网络数据中实现高精度合成。

Abstract: Compilation errors represent a significant bottleneck in software development
productivity. This paper introduces WARP (Web-Augmented Real-time Program
Repairer), a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and
dynamic web-augmented synthesis for real-time resolution of these errors. WARP
actively monitors developer terminals, intelligently detects compilation
errors, and synergistically combines the understanding of a fine-tuned Code-LLM
with relevant solutions, explanations, and code snippets retrieved from
up-to-date web sources like developer forums and official documentation.
Experimental results on our curated benchmark, CGP (featuring C/C++, Python,
and Go errors), demonstrate WARP achieves a superior fix rate (72.5 % Compiles
correctly) and higher semantic correctness compared to baseline LLM-only
approaches and traditional IDE quick-fixes. Key technical challenges in
achieving high-accuracy synthesis from noisy web data.

### [3] [Automated Code Development for PDE Solvers Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25194)
*Haoyang Wu,Xinxin Zhang,Lailai Zhu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM-PDEveloper是一个零样本多智能体LLM框架，专门为偏微分方程库的二次开发者自动化代码开发，能够将数学和算法描述直接转换为源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大语言模型的跨领域知识、文本处理和推理能力，为软件开发特别是偏微分方程数值库开发提供自动化支持，而现有研究主要关注最终用户的案例设置和执行自动化。

Method: 采用零样本多智能体LLM框架，通过端到端的数学到代码方法，生成新的求解器/模块并适配现有代码，实现自增强的持续代码库扩展管道。

Result: 在三个任务上展示了有效性：1)为新PDE构建求解器，2)为给定PDE实现新边界条件，3)修改现有求解器以包含附加项，取得了中等成功率。分析了LLM产生的语法错误并提出有效修复方法。

Conclusion: LLM-PDEveloper框架能够自动化PDE库的代码开发，识别了某些语义错误的机制，为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Foundation models -- large language models (LLMs) in particular -- have
become ubiquitous, shaping daily life and driving breakthroughs across science,
engineering, and technology. Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge,
text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g.,
numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is
therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate
case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a
zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE
libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating
mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code,
LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This
end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that
continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and
broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a
solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an
existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success
rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we
propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain
semantic errors, guiding future research.

### [4] [Understanding Practitioners Perspectives on Monitoring Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25195)
*Hira Naveed,John Grundy,Chetan Arora,Hourieh Khalajzadeh,Omar Haggag*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文通过调查91位ML从业者，探讨了机器学习系统监控的策略、挑战和改进机会，发现从业者面临模型性能下降、延迟超时和安全违规等运行时问题，期望未来监控工具能自动生成部署、改进性能公平性监控并提供问题解决建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于机器学习系统的非确定性特性，其在生产环境中的行为可能导致不可预见且危险的后果。为了及时检测不良行为并防止组织遭受财务和声誉损失，监控这些系统至关重要。

Method: 通过对91位ML从业者进行全球调查，收集关于当前ML系统监控实践的多样化见解，进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 研究发现从业者经常面临模型性能下降、延迟超时和安全违规等运行时问题；大多数偏好自动化监控以提高效率，但由于复杂性或缺乏合适的自动化解决方案，许多人仍依赖手动方法；监控工具的初始设置和配置通常复杂且具有挑战性；监控增加了额外工作量、消耗资源并导致警报疲劳。

Conclusion: 从业者期望的改进包括：监控器的自动生成和部署、改进对性能和公平性监控的支持、以及解决运行时问题的建议。这些见解为未来开发更符合从业者需求的ML监控工具提供了宝贵指导。

Abstract: Given the inherent non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML) systems,
their behavior in production environments can lead to unforeseen and
potentially dangerous outcomes. For a timely detection of unwanted behavior and
to prevent organizations from financial and reputational damage, monitoring
these systems is essential. This paper explores the strategies, challenges, and
improvement opportunities for monitoring ML systems from the practitioners
perspective. We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect
diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to
complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses,
focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation
practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools.
Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues
related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security
violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased
efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack
of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial
setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and
challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert
thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload,
strains resources, and causes alert fatigue. The desired improvements from the
practitioners perspective are: automated generation and deployment of monitors,
improved support for performance and fairness monitoring, and recommendations
for resolving runtime issues. These insights offer valuable guidance for the
future development of ML monitoring tools that are better aligned with
practitioners needs.

### [5] [APRIL: API Synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25196)
*Hua Zhong,Shan Jiang,Sarfraz Khurshid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APRIL结合自动提示优化和基于验证奖励的强化学习，显著提升大型语言模型在API合成任务中的性能，解决了传统组件合成和纯LLM方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统组件合成方法搜索空间大、依赖手工规范，而纯LLM方法存在幻觉问题且难以获取最新上下文信息，导致API合成困难。

Method: 结合自动提示优化(APO)迭代优化提示，以及基于验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)微调策略以确保功能正确性，构建高效合成流程。

Result: 在81个真实世界科学Python库API上评估，相比使用专家提示但未微调的LLM，APRIL取得显著改进。

Conclusion: APO和RLVR的结合为大型库中的组件式API合成提供了稳健、可扩展的路径。

Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from
large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional
component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted
specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations
from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date
contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present
APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):
APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the
policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis
pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python
libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs
guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These
results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path
for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

### [6] [Towards Repository-Level Program Verification with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25197)
*Si Cheng Zhong,Xujie Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RVBench是首个专门为仓库级验证设计的基准测试，RagVerus框架结合检索增强生成和上下文感知提示，在多模块仓库中实现了三倍的证明通过率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法主要关注孤立的函数级验证任务，忽略了跨模块依赖和全局上下文，这些对扩展到真实世界项目验证至关重要。

Method: 引入RagVerus框架，结合检索增强生成和上下文感知提示，自动化多模块仓库的证明合成。

Result: 在受限模型推理预算下，RagVerus将现有基准的证明通过率提高了三倍，在更具挑战性的RVBench基准上实现了27%的相对改进。

Conclusion: RagVerus提供了一个可扩展且样本高效的验证解决方案，能够有效处理仓库级软件验证的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in
code and proof generations. However, scaling automated formal verification to
real-world projects requires resolving cross-module dependencies and global
contexts, which are crucial challenges overlooked by existing LLM-based methods
with a special focus on targeting isolated, function-level verification tasks.
To systematically explore and address the significant challenges of verifying
entire software repositories, we introduce RVBench, the first verification
benchmark explicitly designed for repository-level evaluation, constructed from
four diverse and complex open-source Verus projects.
  We further introduce RagVerus, an extensible framework that synergizes
retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to automate proof
synthesis for multi-module repositories. RagVerus triples proof pass rates on
existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves a
27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark,
demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了CanItEdit开源流水线，使用多个LLM合成真实的代码编辑三元组，构建了OCEDataFT数据集，通过微调显著提升了代码编辑性能，接近闭源系统水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提交的数据集存在噪声大、多样性不足、无法反映真实编辑指令风格的问题，需要构建更高质量的代码编辑数据集。

Method: 开发CanItEdit流水线，利用多个LLM合成代码编辑三元组，生成简洁和详细两种指令，通过差异和主题过滤保证数据质量和多样性，构建OCEDataFT数据集。

Result: 在三个先进基础模型上微调OCEDataFT数据集，在CanItEdit基准测试中相对pass@1提升4.50%到20.79%，性能接近闭源系统，与GPT-4差距缩小到3.54%。

Conclusion: CanItEdit流水线能有效生成高质量代码编辑数据，显著提升模型性能，无需依赖专有资源或人工标注即可接近顶级闭源系统水平。

Abstract: Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers
to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while
keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However,
commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack
diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To
address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages
multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces
both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and
applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and
variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K
samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to
significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1
improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models
achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4
to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.

*Zejun Zhang,Jian Wang,Qingyun Yang,Yifan Pan,Yi Tang,Yi Li,Zhenchang Xing,Tian Zhang,Xuandong Li,Guoan Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了MULocBench，一个包含1100个问题的综合数据集，用于评估软件问题定位方法，相比现有基准具有更多样化的问题类型和文件类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问题定位基准（如SWE-Bench和LocBench）主要关注拉取请求问题和代码位置，忽略了其他证据和非代码文件，需要更全面的评估基准。

Method: 构建了包含1100个问题、来自46个流行GitHub Python项目的MULocBench数据集，评估了最先进的定位方法和五种基于LLM的提示策略。

Result: 当前技术在文件级别的性能指标（Acc@5, F1）仍低于40%，显示出在现实多面问题解决中泛化的挑战。

Conclusion: MULocBench为问题解决的项目定位研究提供了更现实的测试平台，揭示了当前技术的显著局限性。

Abstract: Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue
resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing
benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited.
They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring
other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations,
and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a
comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects.
Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in
issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more
realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based
prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current
techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain
below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic,
multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project
localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/somethingone/MULocBench.

### [10] [Reinforcement Learning-Guided Chain-of-Draft for Token-Efficient Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25243)
*Xunzhu Tang,Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji,Tiezhu Sun,Jacques Klein,Tegawende F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MultiCoD是一个强化学习框架，通过从Chain-of-Draft生成的多个候选中选择最优解决方案，提高了代码生成的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在代码生成中表现出表面流畅性，但在需要正确性和语义对齐的结构化推理任务中表现不佳。现有的Chain-of-Thought提示存在冗长和低效问题，Chain-of-Draft提示虽然更简洁，但LLMs的随机性导致解决方案质量不稳定，难以选择最优结果。

Method: 提出MultiCoD强化学习框架，使用策略引导提示鼓励多样化的推理风格，将解决方案选择建模为上下文多臂赌博机问题。框架通过奖励函数优化可解释特征，包括代码复杂度、推理结构和策略元数据，平衡正确性、效率和清晰度。

Result: 在MBPP、BigCodeBench、SWE-bench Verified和Defects4J等基准测试中，MultiCoD优于或与标准提示、CoT和CoD基线相当，同时通过多候选设计仅对选定输出收费，用户账单减少50%以上，提高了LLM响应质量。

Conclusion: MultiCoD通过强化学习选择最优解决方案，在保持代码生成质量的同时显著提高了效率和成本效益，使其更适合实际部署。

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with
structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps,
it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting
offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces
varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose
\multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most
promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses
strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models
solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes
interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and
strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency,
and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and
Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard
prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency
from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only
for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM
response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world
deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.

*Krishna Vamshi Bodla,Haizhao Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究如何自动采样上下文学习演示来提升大语言模型的代码生成性能，通过AST分析识别代码中受演示影响最大的区域，发现高质量演示能改善模型性能和代码可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在代码生成中的广泛应用，虽然提高了开发效率，但也带来了次优解决方案和不安全代码的风险增加。本文旨在通过优化上下文学习演示来提升模型性能和生成代码的可解释性。

Method: 使用基于AST的分析方法对MBPP测试集的输出进行分析，识别代码中最受演示影响的区域，并自动采样上下文学习演示。

Result: 实验表明，高质量的上下文学习演示不仅使输出更易解释，还在pass@10指标上带来了正向性能提升；而选择不当的演示则会对模型性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 高效的上下文学习演示采样策略对模型在任意任务上的性能都有重要影响，强调了选择合适演示的重要性。

Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely
adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering,
speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code
generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and
Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and
recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the
growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although
these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing
reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of
suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically
sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model
performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using
AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of
code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show
that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret
but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric.
Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on
the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach
highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can
affect the performance of the model on any given task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个更真实和具有挑战性的开源软件编译基准BUILD-BENCH，并开发了基于LLM的智能体OSS-BUILD-AGENT，在多样化质量、规模和特征的开源项目上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动制定的规则和工作流，无法适应需要定制配置或环境设置的开源软件。最近使用大语言模型的尝试只评估了高度评价的开源软件子集，低估了实际编译挑战。

Method: 提出了OSS-BUILD-AGENT智能体系统，包含增强的构建指令检索模块，能够适应异构的开源软件特征。

Result: 在BUILD-BENCH基准上实现了最先进的性能，并对不同编译方法设计选择及其对整个任务的影响进行了详细分析。

Conclusion: BUILD-BENCH的性能能够真实反映智能体处理复杂软件工程任务的能力，该基准将推动软件开发和软件安全领域的创新。

Abstract: Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital,
labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM
Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which
cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment
setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective
evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the
realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions
are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even
require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more
challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more
diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with
enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS
characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different
compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task,
offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on
BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as
a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur
innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields
of software development and software security.

### [13] [RANGER -- Repository-Level Agent for Graph-Enhanced Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25257)
*Pratik Shah,Rajat Ghosh,Aryan Singhal,Debojyoti Dutta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RANGER是一个仓库级代码检索代理，能够处理代码实体查询和自然语言查询，通过构建知识图谱和双阶段检索管道，在多个代码检索任务中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码检索系统主要关注代码实体查询，但缺乏对自然语言查询的处理能力。需要一种能够同时处理两种查询类型的通用代码检索系统。

Method: 首先构建包含层次结构和跨文件依赖关系的知识图谱，节点包含文本描述和嵌入。然后使用双阶段检索管道：代码实体查询通过Cypher查询处理，自然语言查询通过MCTS引导的图探索处理。

Result: 在CodeSearchNet和RepoQA上优于使用Qwen3-8B等强模型嵌入的基线方法；在RepoBench上实现更好的跨文件依赖检索；在CrossCodeEval上与BM25结合实现最高的代码补全精确匹配率。

Conclusion: RANGER通过知识图谱和双阶段检索策略，有效解决了代码实体查询和自然语言查询的代码检索问题，在多个ASE任务中表现出色。

Abstract: General-purpose automated software engineering (ASE) includes tasks such as
code completion, retrieval, repair, QA, and summarization. These tasks require
a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities,
or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving
the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit
code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and
retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code
retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent
works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a
tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,
capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,
and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the
gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph
through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered
through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by
MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse
benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question
answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code
completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that
use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves
superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval,
pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code
completion compared to other RAG methods.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TDDev是一个基于测试驱动开发的LLM智能体框架，能够从自然语言描述或设计图像自动生成全栈Web应用，包括测试用例生成、前后端代码开发、用户交互模拟和迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法只能生成前端页面，无法创建功能完整的全栈应用，且开发过程复杂耗时。

Method: 采用测试驱动开发方法，自动推导可执行测试用例，生成前后端代码，模拟用户交互，并通过迭代优化确保需求满足。

Result: 在多样化应用场景实验中，TDDev相比最先进基线方法整体准确率提升14.4%，能够无需人工干预生成可靠高质量Web应用。

Conclusion: TDDev框架有效解决了全栈自动化中的关键挑战，包括需求不明确、文件间复杂依赖关系以及功能和视觉保真度需求。

Abstract: Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive,
demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although
recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated
webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to
front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this
work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled
LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given
a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives
executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user
interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements
are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation,
including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among
multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual
fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev
achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality
web applications without requiring manual intervention.

*Akalanka Galappaththi,Francisco Ribeiro,Sarah Nadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DSCHECKER是一个基于LLM的方法，用于检测和修复数据科学库中的API误用，通过整合API指令和数据信息来提高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学库（如scikit-learn和pandas）的数据中心特性使得检测其中的API误用更具挑战性

Method: 使用三个LLM和五种数据科学库的误用案例进行实验，识别API指令和数据信息作为关键信息，并实现具有自适应函数调用机制的DSCHECKER代理

Result: 最佳模型实现了61.18%的检测F1分数和51.28%的误用修复率；DSCHECKER代理在真实场景下达到48.65%检测F1分数和39.47%修复率

Conclusion: 基于LLM的API误用检测和修复在真实场景中具有应用前景，整合API指令和数据特定细节能显著提升性能

Abstract: Data science libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, specialize in
processing and manipulating data. The data-centric nature of these libraries
makes the detection of API misuse in them more challenging. This paper
introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based approach designed for detecting and fixing
API misuses of data science libraries. We identify two key pieces of
information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for
API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data
science libraries, we experiment with various prompts. We find that
incorporating API directives and data-specific details enhances Dschecker's
ability to detect and fix API misuses, with the best-performing model achieving
a detection F1-score of 61.18 percent and fixing 51.28 percent of the misuses.
Building on these results, we implement Dschecker agent which includes an
adaptive function calling mechanism to access information on demand, simulating
a real-world setting where information about the misuse is unknown in advance.
We find that Dschecker agent achieves 48.65 percent detection F1-score and
fixes 39.47 percent of the misuses, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based API
misuse detection and fixing in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文通过访谈14个开源大语言模型项目的开发者，探索了开源LLM开发过程中的协作模式、动机和组织模型，揭示了开源LLM生态系统的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补对开源大语言模型开发协作方式的系统性研究空白，理解开源LLM项目如何启动、组织和治理，以及如何进一步促进这一生态系统发展。

Method: 采用探索性分析方法，通过对来自草根项目、研究机构、初创公司和大型科技公司的14个开源LLM开发者进行半结构化访谈。

Result: 发现开源LLM协作涵盖数据集、基准测试、开源框架等多个方面；开发者具有社会、经济和技术等多重动机；识别出五种不同的组织模型，从单一公司项目到非营利赞助的草根项目。

Conclusion: 为寻求支持AI更开放未来的利益相关者提供实践建议，强调开源LLM生态系统的多样性和协作模式的复杂性。

Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant
ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after
their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our
understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed
as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further.
We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration
throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on
semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots
projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research
and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the
LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks,
leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute
partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of
social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access
and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding
language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five
distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to
non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of
control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM
lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking
to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合监督微调和强化学习的专门化模型，用于自动化软件环境设置任务，使较小的模型在性能上能与大型模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件环境设置是软件工程中的持续挑战，现有的大语言模型在此任务上表现有限，需要专门的方法来提升自动化环境配置的能力。

Method: 结合监督微调生成正确的Bash脚本，以及使用可验证奖励的强化学习，专门针对环境设置任务进行模型调优。

Result: 在EnvBench-Python基准测试中，该方法使Qwen3-8B模型达到了与Qwen3-32B和GPT-4o等更大模型相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过专门的任务调优，较小的模型也能在环境设置自动化任务上实现与大型模型相当的性能，为软件工程研究提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a
specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software
Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers
by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without
manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based
benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To
address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We
combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task
of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model
runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B
and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online:

TL;DR: 提出了BloomAPR框架，基于布鲁姆分类学动态评估LLM驱动的自动程序修复能力，发现现有方法在记忆层面表现良好，但在复杂推理层面存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态基准（如Defects4J）的评估存在数据污染风险和动态多样性评估能力有限的问题，需要更可靠的评估框架。

Method: 基于布鲁姆分类学构建动态评估框架，使用Defects4J作为案例研究，评估ChatRepair和CigaR在GPT-3.5-Turbo、Llama-3.1和StarCoder-2三种LLM下的表现。

Result: 现有解决方案在记忆层面修复率高达81.57%，但在理解层面需要合成bug提升性能（增加60.66%），在应用层面仅修复43.32%的语法变更bug，在分析层面仅修复13.46%-41.34%的真实项目bug。

Conclusion: 现有LLM驱动的程序修复解决方案在复杂推理能力上存在明显不足，迫切需要改进基准测试方法，为更可靠的软件工程解决方案评估奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the
development of AI-driven automated program repair (APR) solutions. However,
these solutions are typically evaluated using static benchmarks such as
Defects4J and SWE-bench, which suffer from two key limitations: (1) the risk of
data contamination, potentially inflating evaluation results due to overlap
with LLM training data, and (2) limited ability to assess the APR capabilities
in dynamic and diverse contexts. In this paper, we introduced BloomAPR, a novel
dynamic evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. Our framework offers
a structured approach to assess the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered APR
solutions across progressively complex reasoning levels. Using Defects4J as a
case study, we evaluated two state-of-the-art LLM-powered APR solutions,
ChatRepair and CigaR, under three different LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, and
StarCoder-2. Our findings show that while these solutions exhibit basic
reasoning skills and effectively memorize bug-fixing patterns (fixing up to
81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer), their performance increases with
synthetically generated bugs (up to 60.66% increase at the Understand layer).
However, they perform worse on minor syntactic changes (fixing up to 43.32% at
the Apply layer), and they struggle to repair similar bugs when injected into
real-world projects (solving only 13.46% to 41.34% bugs at the Analyze layer).
These results underscore the urgent need for evolving benchmarks and provide a
foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering
solutions.

TL;DR: AGNOMIN是一个架构无关的多标签函数名预测方法，通过构建特征增强层次图和使用层次图神经网络，在剥离二进制文件中实现跨架构的函数名预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在架构特定限制、数据稀缺和命名约定多样的问题，而函数名预测对于软件逆向工程中的漏洞分析和补丁至关重要。

Method: 构建特征增强层次图（FEHGs），结合控制流图、函数调用图和动态学习的PCode特征，使用层次图神经网络生成跨架构一致的函数表示，并采用改进的Renée解码器进行函数名预测。

Result: 在包含9,000个ELF可执行二进制文件的综合数据集上，AGNOMIN相比最先进方法在测试集上精度提升达27.17%，召回率提升达55.86%，在未见架构上召回率比最接近基线高5.89%。

Conclusion: AGNOMIN在安全黑客马拉松中成功帮助逆向工程师分析和修补跨架构的易受攻击二进制文件，证明了其实际效用和跨架构泛化能力。

Abstract: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in
software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent
vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often
struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse
naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach
for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds
Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs,
Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A
hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate
consistent function representations across architectures, vital for
\textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN
employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer
and algorithmic improvements.
  We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable
binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in
precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN
generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than
the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through
security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing
and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.

Motivation: 随着数字孪生、智慧城市和工业4.0/5.0等复杂动态生态系统的发展，需要在软件开发周期中包含建模与仿真。但软件工程师在选择合适的形式化方法时面临困难。

Method: 基于DEVS、系统动力学和基于代理仿真三种主要形式化方法，建立了一个初步检查清单，并通过试点研究和专家咨询进行评估。

Abstract: The advent of increasingly complex and dynamic ecosystems, such as digital
twins (DT), smart cities and Industry 4.0 and 5.0, has made evident the need to
include modeling and simulation (M&S) in the software development life cycle.
Such disruptive systems include simulation models in their own architecture
(such as DT) or require the use of simulation models to represent the high
degree of movement and the multiplicity of interactions that occur between the
involved systems. However, when software engineers (particularly the newcomers)
need to use M&S in their projects, they often pose themselves an important
question: which formalism should I use? In this direction, the main
contribution of this paper is the establishment of a preliminary checklist with
questions to assist beginners in M&S in choosing the most appropriate paradigm
to solve their problems. The checklist is based on three main formalisms: DEVS,
System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation. A pilot study was carried out and
an expert was consulted. The preliminary results show (i) conformance between
the suggestion given by the checklist and the formalism selected in the
original studies used as input for evaluating the checklist, and (ii) a
positive feedback from the expert.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLAME是一种针对编程作业的细粒度、可解释的故障定位方法，通过LLM引导的注释和模型集成来精确定位代码错误，相比现有方法在准确性和教育价值方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障定位技术在教育环境中面临挑战：方法级定位粒度太粗，缺乏解释性反馈；行级定位方法直接预测行号不适合LLM，无法为学生提供可操作的错误修复指导。

Method: FLAME利用编程作业的丰富上下文信息引导LLM识别错误代码行，通过注释而非直接预测行号的方式，结合加权多模型投票策略聚合多个LLM的结果来确定每行代码的可疑度。

Result: 在编程作业上，FLAME优于最先进的故障定位基线方法，在top-1定位中成功定位了比最佳基线多207个错误；在Defects4J基准测试中也优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FLAME不仅在教育环境中表现出色，还能有效推广到通用软件代码库，为编程作业提供细粒度、可解释的故障定位解决方案。

Abstract: Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming
assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete
assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated
Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in
identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges
when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method
level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for
students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While
some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on
predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to
LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,
explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via
LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual
information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying
faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the
LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both
localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we
introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from
multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault
localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207
more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational
contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software
codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.

Motivation: 解决当前搜索技术仅限于标准RAG查询-文档应用的局限性，以及代码到代码基准数据集中存在的API泄露问题，实现高质量端到端代码生成。

Method: 引入基于真实ServiceNow脚本的新数据集，开发全面的后训练流程，包括合成数据集生成、监督微调和强化学习，优化紧凑的0.6B重排序器。

Result: 达到87.86%的top-40检索准确率，紧凑重排序器在保持2.5倍降低延迟的同时优于更大的8B模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了企业特定代码的细微差别，无需大型模型的计算开销，为自动完成和代理AI应用提供了高质量的端到端代码生成能力。

Abstract: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code
and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality,
end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive
post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic
dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This
approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model
while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of
enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.

Motivation: AI生成代码的普及引入了语法和语义上的克隆变体，这对传统主要针对人工编写代码优化的克隆检测工具提出了新挑战

Method: 使用GPTCloneBench基准测试9种广泛使用的CCD工具，同时在BigCloneBench和SemanticCloneBench上测试以对比传统与AI生成克隆的性能差异

Result: 经典CCD工具特别是那些采用有效标准化技术的工具对AI生成克隆仍保持相当有效性，但部分工具相比传统基准表现出显著性能变化

Conclusion: 标准化技术在提高检测准确性中起关键作用，需要为AI生成代码时代重新评估和优化CCD工具

Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated code has reshaped modern software
development, introducing syntactic and semantic variations in cloned code.
Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic
syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training
data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection
(CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored
codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic
clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex
semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD
tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine
widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing
GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further
test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench
and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between
traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical
CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques,
retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some
exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks. This
paper contributes by (1) evaluating classical CCD tools against AI-generated
clones, providing critical insights into their current strengths and
limitations; (2) highlighting the role of normalization techniques in improving
detection accuracy; and (3) delivering detailed scalability and execution-time
analyses to support practical CCD tool selection.

TL;DR: LogPilot是一个基于大语言模型的自动化日志诊断框架，通过意图感知和可扩展的方法解决大规模在线服务系统的告警诊断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化工具在告警诊断中存在两个主要问题：告警无关的日志范围界定不当，以及无法有效组织复杂数据以支持推理。工程师需要手动检查大量日志来定位根因，效率低下。

Method: LogPilot采用意图感知方法解析告警定义逻辑，精确识别因果相关的日志和请求。通过将请求执行重构为时空日志链，聚类相似链识别重复执行模式，并为LLM提供代表性样本进行诊断。

Result: 在火山引擎云的真实告警评估中，LogPilot将根因摘要的有用性提高了50.34%，精确定位准确率提高了54.79%。诊断时间低于1分钟，每个告警成本仅0.074美元。

Conclusion: LogPilot提供了一个自动化且实用的服务告警诊断解决方案，已在生产环境中成功部署。

Abstract: Effective alert diagnosis is essential for ensuring the reliability of
large-scale online service systems. However, on-call engineers are often
burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root
causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in
practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize
complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot
introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert
definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and
requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into
a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring
execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for
diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in
diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window.
Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the
usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization
accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under
one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully
deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for
service alert diagnosis.

TL;DR: SWExploit是一种针对LLM-based自动程序修复代理的攻击方法，通过生成对抗性GitHub问题描述，诱导代理产生功能正确但存在安全漏洞的补丁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注APR生成补丁的功能正确性，而忽略了潜在的安全风险。由于GitHub平台的开放性，恶意用户可能提交误导性问题，诱导代理生成有漏洞的补丁。

Method: SWExploit包含三个步骤：程序分析识别漏洞注入点；生成保留原始语义但包含误导信息的对抗性问题；基于代理输出迭代优化对抗性问题。

Result: 在三个代理流水线和五个后端LLM上的实验表明，SWExploit能成功生成功能正确但存在漏洞的补丁，攻击成功率可达0.91，而基线方法均低于0.20。

Conclusion: 该研究首次挑战了"通过所有测试的补丁就是可靠安全"的传统假设，揭示了当前APR代理评估范式的关键局限性。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks
such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub
issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs.
However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of
APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while
largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like
GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an
important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on
GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct
but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which
generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce
patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in
three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points
for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading
reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue
semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements
based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent
pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that
are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the
correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20).
Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional
assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure,
highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR
agents.

Abstract: The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current
approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label
pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose
LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's
imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm
critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To
address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm
that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human
engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying
rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing
hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first
cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13
strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning
capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.
Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing
methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by
228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the
efficacy.

TL;DR: JiraGPT Next是一个基于GPT大语言模型的Jira插件，为项目经理提供自然语言界面来简化数据检索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目管理工具通常学习曲线陡峭且需要复杂编程语言来检索数据，项目经理在处理大量数据时面临挑战。

Method: 开发Jira插件，利用GPT大语言模型提供自然语言查询接口，评估不同提示词对任务完成准确性的影响。

Result: 该软件能够简化项目经理处理大量数据的过程，通过自然语言界面提高数据检索效率。

Conclusion: JiraGPT Next通过自然语言接口有效降低了项目管理工具的使用门槛，提升了数据检索的便捷性。

Abstract: In the domain of Project Management, the sheer volume of data is a challenge
that project managers continually have to deal with. Effectively steering
projects from inception to completion requires handling of diverse information
streams, including timelines, budgetary considerations, and task dependencies.
To navigate this data-driven landscape with precision and agility, project
managers must rely on efficient and sophisticated tools. These tools have
become essential, as they enable project managers to streamline communication,
optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions in real-time.
However, many of these tools have steep learning curves and require using
complex programming languages to retrieve the exact data that project managers
need. In this work we present JiraGPT Next, a software that uses the GPT Large
Language Model to ease the process by which project managers deal with large
amounts of data. It is conceived as an add-on for Jira, one of the most popular
Project Management tools, and provides a natural language interface to retrieve
information. This work presents the design decisions behind JiraGPT Next and an
evaluation of the accuracy of GPT in this context, including the effects of
providing different prompts to complete a particular task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探索Android应用中常见代码重构对性能和能耗的影响，发现某些代码坏味重构能降低能耗达10.8%，但能耗减少与执行时间变化无直接关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用能耗问题受到广泛关注，研究表明通过提高应用质量可以改善移动设备能耗，频繁重构是实现这一目标的途径之一。

Method: 实验研究Android应用中几种常见代码重构的性能和能耗影响，分析不同代码坏味重构的能耗变化。

Result: 重复代码和类型检查的代码坏味重构能降低能耗达10.8%，但能耗减少与执行时间变化无直接关系，不同重构顺序对能耗影响各异。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究软件应用的大小、年龄、开发者经验等因素与代码坏味数量、类型以及重构后能耗性能影响的相关性。

Abstract: Energy consumption of mobile apps is a domain that is receiving a lot of
attention from researchers. Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption
of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps.
Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we
explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings
in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell
refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps.
Refactoring of the code smells "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" reduce
energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption,
however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of
execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell
refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order
in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that
some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy
consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to
investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and
number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and
type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and
performance after refactoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业科学库如Gammapy缺乏文档、示例和社区支持，且API不稳定，使得基于有限或过时数据训练的LLM难以有效生成代码。

Method: 开发了一个代理系统，能够在受控环境中编写、执行和验证Gammapy库的代码，并提供了Web演示和基准测试套件。

Result: 构建了一个最小化的Web演示和配套的基准测试套件，能够有效处理Gammapy库的代码生成任务。

Conclusion: 该工作为专业科学库的代码生成提供了可行解决方案，总结了设计思路、当前进展并规划了下一步工作。

Abstract: Software code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the
most successful applications of modern artificial intelligence. Foundational
models are very effective for popular frameworks that benefit from
documentation, examples, and strong community support. In contrast, specialized
scientific libraries often lack these resources and may expose unstable APIs
under active development, making it difficult for models trained on limited or
outdated data. We address these issues for the Gammapy library by developing an
agent capable of writing, executing, and validating code in a controlled
environment. We present a minimal web demo and an accompanying benchmarking
suite. This contribution summarizes the design, reports our current status, and
outlines next steps.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了MultiOOP基准测试，这是一个多语言面向对象编程基准，涵盖6种流行编程语言，每个语言267个任务，解决了现有基准测试在语言多样性、任务复杂性和测试用例数量方面的不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试存在三个主要不平衡：85.7%只关注单一编程语言；94.3%只针对函数级或语句级任务；超过80%平均包含少于10个测试用例。这些限制阻碍了对LLM代码生成能力的全面评估。

Method: 设计了一个翻译器将现有的单语言OOP基准扩展到多语言环境，提出了pass@o度量标准，并开发了自动测试用例增强框架以确保评估结果的可靠性。

Result: 评估了14个主流LLM，发现三个关键结果：1)性能显著下降，与函数级任务相比pass@1分数下降高达65.6个百分点；2)跨语言变异性大，GPT-4o mini在Python中达到48.06%但在其他语言仅0.12%-15.26%；3)概念差距，pass@o分数比pass@k低1.1-19.2分，表明LLM常生成可执行代码但未完全掌握核心OOP概念。

Conclusion: MultiOOP基准测试、度量扩展和评估脚本将公开发布，以促进对LLM在面向对象代码生成方面更平衡和全面的评估。

Abstract: Establishing fair and robust benchmarks is essential for evaluating
intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35
existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single
programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level
tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address
these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming
benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an
existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual
setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases
to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream
LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial
performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6
percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2)
Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but
only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual
generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2
points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable
code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric
extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more
balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code
generation. Our code and data will be released at
https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeai-dteam/MultiOOP respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解软件开发者集体社会行为对于建模和预测开源软件社区的长期动态和可持续性至关重要，特别是探索提交贡献的爆发性现象背后的社会机制。

Method: 采用基于网络的建模框架，通过共同编辑网络捕捉开发者互动，开发了识别活动级联的方法，并基于此构建了开发者流失预测模型。

Result: 在超过一半的研究项目中发现了统计显著的活动级联现象，基于此开发的流失预测方法能够有效预测哪些开发者可能离开项目。

Conclusion: 活动级联是开源软件社区中重要的集体社会动态现象，对理解开发者流失和保留具有关键意义。

Abstract: Understanding the collective social behavior of software developers is
crucial to model and predict the long-term dynamics and sustainability of Open
Source Software (OSS) communities. To this end, we analyze temporal activity
patterns of developers, revealing an inherently ``bursty'' nature of commit
contributions. To investigate the social mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
adopt a network-based modelling framework that captures developer interactions
through co-editing networks. Our framework models social interactions, where a
developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity
among collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we
further develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the
propagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our
results suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant
phenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our
insights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method
that forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds
light on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and
highlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn
and retention in collaborative software projects.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析170万个Java开发者编写的测试用例，揭示了当前自动化测试生成工具与开发者实际测试实践之间的差距，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动化测试生成技术研究多年，但缺乏对开发者实际测试特征的理解，导致难以评估ATG工具生成测试的真实性和代表性。

Method: 对开源仓库中的170万个Java测试用例进行实证研究，分析测试范围、测试装置、断言、输入类型和模拟使用等被现有文献忽视的方面。

Result: 研究发现绝大多数开发者编写的测试具有当前ATG工具无法复现的特征，现有ATG工具生成的测试与开发者测试存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果识别了有前景的研究方向，希望推动ATG工具更接近生成开发者实际编写的测试类型。

Abstract: Automated test generation (ATG), which aims to reduce the cost of manual test
suite development, has been investigated for decades and has produced countless
techniques based on a variety of approaches: symbolic analysis, search-based,
random and adaptive-random, learning-based, and, most recently,
large-language-model-based approaches. However, despite this large body of
research, there is still a gap in our understanding of the characteristics of
developer-written tests and, consequently, in our assessment of how well ATG
techniques and tools can generate realistic and representative tests. To bridge
this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study of developer-written tests
for Java applications, covering 1.7 million test cases from open-source
repositories. Our study is the first of its kind in studying aspects of
developer-written tests that are mostly neglected in the existing literature,
such as test scope, test fixtures and assertions, types of inputs, and use of
mocking. Based on the characterization, we then compare existing tests with
those generated by two state-of-the-art ATG tools. Our results highlight that a
vast majority of developer-written tests exhibit characteristics that are
beyond the capabilities of current ATG tools. Finally, based on the insights
gained from the study, we identify promising research directions that can help
bridge the gap between current tool capabilities and more effective tool
support for developer testing practices. We hope that this work can set the
stage for new advances in the field and bring ATG tools closer to generating
the types of tests developers write.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UniSage是一个统一框架，采用后分析感知范式对追踪和日志进行采样，通过轻量级多模态异常检测和根因分析指导采样策略，在2.5%采样率下能捕获56.5%关键追踪和96.25%相关日志。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分布式系统中追踪和日志数据量巨大，现有采样方法会丢弃故障相关信息，影响系统行为诊断的透明度。

Method: 首先在完整数据流上执行轻量级多模态异常检测和根因分析，然后采用双支柱采样策略：分析引导采样器优先处理RCA涉及的数据，边缘案例采样器确保捕获罕见但关键的行为。

Result: 在2.5%采样率下，捕获56.5%关键追踪和96.25%相关日志，下游根因分析准确率提升42.45%，10分钟遥测数据处理时间低于5秒。

Conclusion: UniSage通过后分析感知范式显著优于现有方法，能在低采样率下保持对关键信号的全面覆盖，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Traces and logs are essential for observability and fault diagnosis in modern
distributed systems. However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial
storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically
adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics,
they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in
diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first
unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware
paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight
and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete
data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic
insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal
and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated
by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors
are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical
signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5%
sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant
logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by
42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry
data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production
environments.

Motivation: 研究软件在现代科学中日益重要，但研究机构对软件及其人员的认可和支持发展不足，需要系统性的政策支持。

Method: PRO4RS工作组通过分析全球机构的研究软件政策现状，识别关键政策缺口，特别关注研究软件人员在研究评估改革中的考量。

Result: 发现研究机构层面的研究软件政策仍然有限或缺乏广度，特别是在人员认可和奖励结构方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 研究机构必须实施全面的研究软件政策，以支持软件开发、使用和可持续性，这对现代研究环境的健康发展至关重要。

Abstract: As research software becomes increasingly central to modern science,
research-performing organisations (RPOs) need to ensure that their investment
in people, skills and infrastructure around research software produces
sustainable and maintainable software that improves the research they perform,
which in turn improves the overall institution and its reputation and funding,
for example, by competing with peers who lack this approach. However, research
institution management and recognition of research software and its personnel
has mostly often developed in an ad hoc manner. RPO training infrastructures,
recognition and reward structures, have not developed at a sufficient rate to
support and encourage both the widespread use of research software best
practices and the long-term support for technical roles that is required. To
begin to address this fundamental problem for modern research environments,
RPOs must implement and adopt robust policies to support research software
development, use, and sustainability. Despite growing momentum from funders and
publishers around FAIR and open science principles, research
institutional-level policies specifically addressing research software remain
limited or lacking in breadth.
  This article outlines the work of the Policies in Research Organisations for
Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group (WG), a joint initiative of the
Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA), which
examined and advanced research software policy development across institutions
worldwide. After consideration of the rationale for institutional policies on
research software, the PRO4RS WG outputs and analysis are utilised to highlight
critical policy gaps, particularly related to consideration of research
software personnel in policy work focused on reform of research assessment.

*Robin Lee,Youngho Nam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EQ-Robin是一个轻量级流水线，通过生成多个语义等效的布尔表达式变体，系统性地产生最小化的Unique-Cause MC/DC测试套件家族，以解决单个测试套件可能因非法输入而无法达到100%覆盖率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Robin's Rule算法虽然能构建理论最小N+1测试用例，但只生成单个测试套件。如果某个必需的'独立对'测试用例是系统约束禁止的非法输入，该套件就无法实现100%覆盖率，存在关键风险。

Method: 通过对抽象语法树(AST)应用代数重排，系统性地生成语义等效的奇异布尔表达式(SBEs)变体，然后对每个结构变体应用Robin's Rule，产生多样化的测试套件集合。

Result: EQ-Robin能够生成保持N+1最小性保证的有效测试套件家族，为在现实约束下实现稳健的MC/DC覆盖率提供了弹性路径。

Conclusion: EQ-Robin通过生成多个语义等效表达式变体及其对应的测试套件，为解决MC/DC测试中因非法输入导致的覆盖率失败问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), particularly its strict
Unique-Cause form, is a cornerstone of safety-critical software verification. A
recent algorithm, "Robin's Rule," introduced a deterministic method to
construct the theoretical minimum of N+1 test cases for Singular Boolean
Expressions (SBEs). However, this approach yields only a single test suite,
introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence
pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to
achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline
that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to
mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating
semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying
Robin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be
produced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that
preserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.
We outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how
EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage.

TL;DR: ErrorPrism：一种自动化重建微服务系统中错误传播路径的工具，通过静态分析和LLM代理迭代反向搜索，在字节跳动67个生产微服务上达到97.0%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务系统中由于故障级联效应，可靠性管理具有挑战性。错误包装实践虽然丰富了错误上下文，但导致从最终日志消息回溯到错误源头的完整传播路径难以追踪。

Method: 首先对服务代码库进行静态分析，构建函数调用图并将日志字符串映射到相关候选函数，然后使用LLM代理执行迭代反向搜索来重建完整的多跳错误路径。

Result: 在字节跳动的67个生产微服务上评估，ErrorPrism对102个真实世界错误的重建路径准确率达到97.0%，优于现有的静态分析和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: ErrorPrism为工业微服务系统的根本原因分析提供了一个有效且实用的工具。

Abstract: Reliability management in cloud service systems is challenging due to the
cascading effect of failures. Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern
microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the
function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from
its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a
significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation
path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are
ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism
in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in
production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on
service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to
relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space
for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an
iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop
error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism
achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors,
outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism
provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial
microservice systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动验证代码推理代理答案的方法，通过形式化验证和程序分析工具来检查代理的推理步骤，以提高其可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based代理在代码推理中答案不总是正确，这限制了其在需要高精度场景（如代码理解、代码审查、代码生成验证）中的应用。手动验证答案会增加人力成本，降低开发效率。

Method: 提取代理响应的形式化表示，然后使用形式化验证和程序分析工具来验证代理的推理步骤。

Result: 在20个未初始化变量错误检测中，形式化验证成功验证了13/20个例子的代理推理；在20个程序等价性查询中，成功捕获了6/8个代理的错误判断。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动验证代码推理代理的答案，提高其可信度和实用性，减少人工验证需求。

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning
questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from
being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a
software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer
during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an
automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,
improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be
manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses
from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower
developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In
this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided
by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high
level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's
response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis
tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable
errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the
uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to
validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program
equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8
incorrect judgments made by the agent.

TL;DR: NatGI是一个基于LLM指导的语法推断框架，通过括号引导的探索、LLM驱动的生成和分层增量调试，显著提升了黑盒上下文无关语法推断的准确性、可扩展性和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语法推断工具（如Arvada、TreeVada、Kedavra）在处理大型复杂语言时存在可扩展性、可读性和准确性不足的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 括号引导的气泡探索：利用括号等语法线索提出结构良好的语法片段
2. LLM驱动的气泡生成和非终端标记：使用LLM生成有意义的非终端名称并选择更有前景的合并
3. 分层增量调试（HDD）：系统性地简化语法树，使语法更加紧凑和可解释

Result: 在从小型语言到大型语言（如lua、c、mysql）的综合基准测试中，NatGI平均F1得分为0.57，比最佳基线TreeVada高出25个百分点，在可解释性方面也显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NatGI通过结合LLM指导的节点重命名和气泡探索，能够生成具有有意义非终端名称和紧凑结构的语法规则，更符合人类直觉，使开发者和研究人员能够获得更高准确性的同时轻松检查、验证和推理诱导语法的结构和语义。

Abstract: Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis,
reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada,
and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large,
complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference
framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key
innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation
and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for
systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic
cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while
LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising
merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the
grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI
on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones
such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms
strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score
of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing
baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars
perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.
Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules
with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more
closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can
achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and
reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线充电的普及，公共场合的能量访问保护和网络安全日益重要。目前最常见的能量加密方法使用频率和阻抗变化，但作者证明这种方法不可靠，因为黑客可以检测频率变化并调整补偿。

Method: 优化攻击系统，消除耗时的最大接收电流调节，使用主接收线圈而非额外传感器来检测磁场变化，从而简化硬件并提高响应速度。

Result: 仿真模型和实验结果表明，攻击系统能在0.2毫秒内快速响应加密无线功率，成功窃取65%的能量。

Conclusion: 该攻击方法的适用性显著提高，为加密系统的加固留下较少空间，表明能量访问保护需要高度重视。

Abstract: With the popularity of wireless charging, energy access protection and
cybersecurity are gaining importance, especially in public places. Currently,
the most common energy encryption method uses frequency and associated
impedance variation. However, we have proven that this method is not reliable,
since a hacker can detect the changing frequency and adjust the compensation.
However, the previously presented system needed time to follow the updated
frequency, while encryption systems may vary the frequency faster to avoid
energy theft. Furthermore, the previous system required an additional sensor
coil. To solve these problems, we optimized the attack and the associated
system, which can intrude and steal energy within 0.2 ms. The key is the
elimination of the time-consuming maximum receiver current regulation. Also, we
use the main receiving coil rather than any additional sensor antenna to detect
the magnetic field. Thus, the new hardware is even simpler. A simulation model
and experimental results demonstrate the fast response speed of the attack on
encrypted wireless power and steal 65% of the power. Overall, the applicability
of the attack is highly improved and leaves less room for hardening the
encryption. The results demonstrate that energy access protection needs to be
given great attention.

*Korok Ray,Sindura Saraswathi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文研究加密货币中阈值签名方案的最优设计，平衡安全性和可用性，提出动态阈值签名方案的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在比特币等加密货币协议中，资金通过m-of-n阈值签名保护，需要至少m个签名才能解锁资金。用户设计这种方案时面临安全性和可用性的权衡：更高的阈值提供更多安全性，但也可能使用户无法访问自己的资金。

Method: 建模动态阈值签名方案，其中用户或攻击者获取签名的概率随时间衰减。分析如何通过提高签名安全性或可用性来允许更高的阈值和更长的时间锁。

Result: 研究发现动态阈值签名方案是最优的，增加安全性和可用性可以支持更高的阈值和更长的时间锁。

Conclusion: 最优阈值设计需要在安全性和可用性之间取得平衡，动态阈值签名方案通过随时间衰减的签名获取概率提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We formulate the design of a threshold signature scheme as made possible on
cryptocurrency protocols like Bitcoin. The funds are secured by an m-of-n
threshold signature, where at least m signatures are needed to unlock the
funds. A user designs this scheme knowing that a malicious attacker can also
obtain the signatures with some probability. Higher thresholds offer more
security, but also risk locking the user out of his own funds. The optimal
threshold balances these twin effects. Interventions like increasing the
security or usability of the signatures allow for higher thresholds. We model
dynamic threshold signature schemes, where the probability of a user or
attacker obtaining signatures decays with time. A dynamic threshold signature
scheme is optimal, and increasing security or usability allows for higher
thresholds and longer time locks.

Motivation: 网络犯罪如在线诈骗日益普遍，网络犯罪分子经常滥用全球或区域事件作为欺诈活动主题，通过精心制作的恶意网站操纵和欺骗无辜用户。为了深入理解这一问题，需要研究如何表征事件主题的恶意网站活动。

Method: 采用可解释的无监督聚类方法，以战争主题网站为案例研究，分析攻击者如何利用事件的独特方面定制攻击策略。

Result: 研究发现攻击者通过利用事件的独特方面（如募款、提供援助、收集必需品或寻求最新新闻）来定制攻击，无监督聚类方法能够提供进一步洞察。

Conclusion: 该方法可为设计针对各种事件主题恶意网络活动的有效早期防御提供指导。

Abstract: Cybercrimes such as online scams and fraud have become prevalent.
Cybercriminals often abuse various global or regional events as themes of their
fraudulent activities to breach user trust and attain a higher attack success
rate. These attacks attempt to manipulate and deceive innocent people into
interacting with meticulously crafted websites with malicious payloads,
phishing, or fraudulent transactions. To deepen our understanding of the
problem, this paper investigates how to characterize event-themed malicious
website-based campaigns, with a case study on war-themed websites. We find that
attackers tailor their attacks by exploiting the unique aspects of events, as
evidenced by activities such as fundraising, providing aid, collecting
essential supplies, or seeking updated news. We use explainable unsupervised
clustering methods to draw further insights, which could guide the design of
effective early defenses against various event-themed malicious web campaigns.

TL;DR: LTag是一个低延迟、运营商无关的可扩展系统，用于在用户数据传输前监控所有运营商的蜂窝连接，能够在2.3毫秒内确定信号来源位置，实现及时通信抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蜂窝监控系统缺乏实时能力，需要多运营商合作且难以部署。运营商无关的方法要么缺乏低延迟能力，要么无法扩展，无法满足敏感区域对未经授权通信的及时检测和阻断需求。

Method: LTag由多个下行嗅探器和分布式上行嗅探器网络组成，测量下行协议信息和多位置上行信号特征，在UE连接建立前聚合处理信息并提供连接决策。

Result: 在地理围栏场景中，LTag能够在初始基站到设备消息后的2.3毫秒内确定信号来自区域内部还是外部，在用户数据传输前实现及时定向通信抑制。

Conclusion: LTag填补了低延迟蜂窝监控系统的关键空白，为敏感区域提供运营商无关的实时监控能力，能够及时检测和阻断未经授权的通信。

Abstract: The widespread availability of cellular devices introduces new threat vectors
that allow users or attackers to bypass security policies and physical barriers
and bring unauthorized devices into sensitive areas. These threats can arise
from user non-compliance or deliberate actions aimed at data
exfiltration/infiltration via hidden devices, drones, etc. We identify a
critical gap in this context: the absence of low-latency systems for
high-quality and instantaneous monitoring of cellular transmissions. Such
low-latency systems are crucial to allow for timely detection, decision (e.g.,
geofencing or localization), and disruption of unauthorized communication in
sensitive areas. Operator-based monitoring systems, built for purposes such as
people counting or tracking, lack real-time capability, require cooperation
across multiple operators, and thus are hard to deploy. Operator-independent
monitoring approaches proposed in the literature either lack low-latency
capabilities or do not scale.
  We propose LTag, the first low-latency, operator-independent and scalable
system designed to monitor cellular connections across all operators prior to
any user data transmission. LTag consists of several downlink sniffers and a
distributed network of uplink sniffers that measure both downlink protocol
information and uplink signal characteristics at multiple locations to gain a
detailed spatial image of uplink signals. LTag aggregates the recorded
information, processes it, and provides a decision about the connection all
prior to connection establishment of a UE. To evaluate LTag, we deployed it in
the context of geofencing, where LTag was able to determine if the signals
originate from inside or outside of an area within 2.3 ms of the initial base
station-to-device message, therefore enabling prompt and targeted suppression
of communication before any user data was transmitted.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMPrint是一个检测大语言模型来源的框架，通过利用LLM对提示注入的固有脆弱性构建指纹，能够有效识别模型是否源自某个基础模型，即使经过后处理也能保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型来源检测方法存在两个主要局限：需要在发布前嵌入信号（对已发布模型不可行），或使用手工/随机提示比较输出（对后处理不鲁棒）。

Method: 通过优化指纹提示来强制一致的token偏好，构建既对基础模型唯一又对后处理鲁棒的指纹，并开发适用于灰盒和黑盒场景的统一验证程序。

Result: 在5个基础模型和约700个后训练或量化变体上的评估显示，LLMPrint实现了高真阳性率，同时保持假阳性率接近零。

Conclusion: LLMPrint提供了一种有效的模型来源检测方法，能够克服现有方法的局限性，在多种后处理场景下保持鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through
post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it
challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing
provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals
into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published
models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random
prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose
LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by
exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is
that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,
we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to
post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that
applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.
We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or
quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive
rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

Abstract: Mobile networks in the 5G and 6G era require to rethink how to manage
security due to the introduction of new services, use cases, each with its own
security requirements, while simultaneously expanding the threat landscape.
Although automation has emerged as a key enabler to address complexity in
networks, existing approaches lack the expressiveness to define and enforce
complex, goal-driven, and measurable security requirements. In this paper, we
propose the concept of differentiated security levels and leveraging intents as
a management framework. We discuss the requirements and enablers to extend the
currently defined intent-based management frameworks to pave the path for
intent-based security management in mobile networks. Our approach formalizes
both functional and non-functional security requirements and demonstrates how
these can be expressed and modeled using an extended TM Forum (TMF) intent
security ontology. We further discuss the required standardization steps to
achieve intent-based security management. Our work aims at advance security
automation, improve adaptability, and strengthen the resilience and security
posture of the next-generation mobile networks.

Abstract: Blockchain technology has spawned a vast ecosystem of digital currencies with
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) -- digital forms of fiat currency --
being one of them. An important feature of digital currencies is facilitating
transactions without network connectivity, which can enhance the scalability of
cryptocurrencies and the privacy of CBDC users. However, in the case of CBDCs,
this characteristic also introduces new regulatory challenges, particularly
when it comes to applying established Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) frameworks. This paper introduces a prototype
for offline digital currency payments, equally applicable to cryptocurrencies
and CBDCs, that leverages Secure Elements and digital credentials to address
the tension of offline payment support with regulatory compliance. Performance
evaluation results suggest that the prototype can be flexibly adapted to
different regulatory environments, with a transaction latency comparable to
real-life commercial payment systems. Furthermore, we conceptualize how the
integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs into our design could accommodate various
tiers of enhanced privacy protection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为环境速率操纵(ERM)的新型硬件木马触发机制，通过监测环境参数的变化速率而非绝对值来激活，能够逃避传统检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬件木马依赖数字触发器或固定阈值条件，容易被标准测试检测。随着全球供应链复杂性增加，需要更隐蔽的触发机制来应对传感器电力电子中的安全威胁。

Method: 设计了一个紧凑的14μm²电路，测量标准传感器前端中电容充电速率，当检测到快速变化时破坏逆变器脉宽调制(PWM)信号。

Result: 在德州仪器太阳能逆变器上的实验表明，ERM能够触发灾难性的驱动芯片故障。ETAP模拟显示单个受感染的100kW逆变器可能引发级联网格不稳定性。

Conclusion: ERM攻击的重要性超越了单个传感器，影响了电力电子中常见的整个环境传感系统类别，揭示了硬件安全的基本挑战。

Abstract: The growing complexity of global supply chains has made hardware Trojans a
significant threat in sensor-based power electronics. Traditional Trojan
designs depend on digital triggers or fixed threshold conditions that can be
detected during standard testing. In contrast, we introduce Environmental Rate
Manipulation (ERM), a novel Trojan triggering mechanism that activates by
monitoring the rate of change in environmental parameters rather than their
absolute values. This approach allows the Trojan to remain inactive under
normal conditions and evade redundancy and sensor-fusion defenses. We implement
a compact 14~$\mu$m$^2$ circuit that measures capacitor charging rates in
standard sensor front-ends and disrupts inverter pulse-width modulation PWM
signals when a rapid change is induced. Experiments on a commercial Texas
Instruments solar inverter demonstrate that ERM can trigger catastrophic driver
chip failure. Furthermore, ETAP simulations indicate that a single compromised
100~kW inverter may initiate cascading grid instabilities. The attack's
significance extends beyond individual sensors to entire classes of
environmental sensing systems common in power electronics, demonstrating
fundamental challenges for hardware security.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理多种模态数据时展现了强大能力，但也带来了严重的隐私泄露风险，特别是个人身份信息泄露问题，而现有研究主要关注单模态模型，多模态场景下的漏洞尚未充分研究

Method: 引入概念引导缓解方法，识别并修改模型内部与PII相关内容相关的状态，引导视觉语言模型有效拒绝PII敏感任务，无需重新训练或微调

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种PII相关任务中平均拒绝率达到93.3%，且对无关模型性能影响最小

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解多模态大语言模型的PII泄露风险，展示了良好的适应性和实用性

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in processing and reasoning over diverse modalities, but their
advanced abilities also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly
regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. While relevant
research has been conducted on single-modal language models to some extent, the
vulnerabilities in the multimodal setting have yet to be fully investigated. In
this work, we investigate these emerging risks with a focus on vision language
models (VLMs), a representative subclass of MLLMs that covers the two
modalities most relevant for PII leakage, vision and text. We introduce a
concept-guided mitigation approach that identifies and modifies the model's
internal states associated with PII-related content. Our method guides VLMs to
refuse PII-sensitive tasks effectively and efficiently, without requiring
re-training or fine-tuning. We also address the current lack of multimodal PII
datasets by constructing various ones that simulate real-world scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that the method can achieve an average refusal
rate of 93.3% for various PII-related tasks with minimal impact on unrelated
model performances. We further examine the mitigation's performance under
various conditions to show the adaptability of our proposed method.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆日益增长的网络连接性带来了新的网络安全挑战，传统的边界安全模型在动态不可信环境中不再适用，需要新的安全框架来应对冒充和重放攻击。

Method: 结合零信任架构的"永不信任、始终验证"原则与区块链的防篡改和去中心化特性，使用Hyperledger Iroha实现轻量级安全认证，无需中央可信实体。

Result: 在城市和高速公路场景下的实验评估显示，该协议引入的性能开销最小：城市环境中包接收率降低不到7.5%，LTE-V2X的信道繁忙比增加不到11%。

Conclusion: 该D-IM框架为实时V2X通信提供了高效且鲁棒的安全基础，能够有效抵御冒充和重放攻击，同时保持实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises to significantly enhance
transportation safety and efficiency by mitigating human error, which is
responsible for over 90\% of road accidents. However, the increasing
connectivity of AVs introduces new cybersecurity challenges, as traditional
perimeter-based security models are inadequate for dynamic and untrusted
environments. This paper presents a novel Zero Trust-based Decentralized
Identity Management (D-IM) protocol for AVs. By integrating the core principles
of Zero Trust Architecture, "never trust, always verify", with the tamper
resistant and decentralized nature of a blockchain network, our framework
eliminates reliance on centralized authorities and provides continuous
verification for every entity. We detail the system's design, which leverages
Hyperledger Iroha to enable lightweight and secure authentication without a
central trusted entity. A comprehensive experimental evaluation, conducted
across both urban and highway scenarios, validates the protocol's practicality.
Our results demonstrate that the D-IM framework introduces minimal overhead,
with less than 7.5\% reduction in Packet Reception Rate (PRR) in urban settings
and an increase of under 11\% in Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) for LTE-V2X. These
findings prove the protocol's efficiency and robustness, providing a resilient
foundation for securing real-time V2X communication against impersonation and
replay attacks.

Motivation: 随着LLM发展为具有工具使用能力的自主代理，传统的内容安全关注已不足够，需要研究针对工具使用的新型安全威胁。

Method: 开发了STAC自动化框架，通过闭环流水线合成可执行的多步骤工具链，在环境中验证执行，并逆向工程隐蔽的多轮提示来诱导代理执行恶意序列。

Result: 评估显示最先进的LLM代理对STAC攻击高度脆弱，攻击成功率超过90%，现有基于提示的防御效果有限。

Conclusion: 防御工具化代理需要在整个动作序列及其累积效应上进行推理，而非孤立评估提示或响应。

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动化语言处理系统中广泛应用，但其对提示注入攻击的脆弱性成为一个严重的安全问题，现有防御方法存在适应性攻击漏洞或无法用于最先进模型。

Method: 采用类型导向权限分离方法，通过将第三方不受信任内容转换为经过筛选的数据类型集合，限制LLM与外部数据的交互能力，每种数据类型在范围和内容上都受到限制。

Result: 在多个案例研究中验证了该方法，发现基于该原则的设计能够系统性地防止提示注入攻击，同时保持较高的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的类型导向权限分离方法为LLM提供了有效的提示注入防御机制，在保证安全性的同时维持了模型的功能性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their
ability to interact with unstructured content. As such, LLMs are now a key
driver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents.
Unfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt
injections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended
functionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors
and finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to
adaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we
propose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that
systematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to
interact with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set
of data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and
content, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections. We evaluate our
method across several case studies and find that designs leveraging our
principles can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while
maintaining high utility.

Abstract: Integrating SDN and the IoT enhances network control and flexibility.
DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in
SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly
degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of
adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT
environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model
and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model,
and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate
white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets.
Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by
up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&W
and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training
enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time
deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures,
including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and
explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat
models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack
categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous
research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD
models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience,
interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a
foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance
DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial
threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical
studies.

Motivation: 为真随机数生成器中的线性提取器提供精确的安全边界，改进之前近似方法的安全评估，量化硬件实现中随机性提取的固有成本。

Method: 使用傅里叶分析，通过在最优ℓ∞和ℓ2范数结果之间插值，通过码重枚举器和输入偏置参数表达，扫描约20,000个码来研究权衡关系。

Result: 安全边界比之前的近似方法提高了一个数量级，揭示了压缩效率与密码安全性之间的基本权衡，例如实现80位安全可能需要牺牲超过50%的码率来纠正10%的输入偏置。

Conclusion: 提出的边界增强了TRNG后处理方案的安全评估，并量化了硬件实现中随机性提取的固有成本。

Abstract: Using Fourier analysis, this paper establishes exact security bounds for
linear extractors in True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). We provide the
first near-optimal total variation security characterization by interpolating
between optimal $\ell_{\infty}$ and $\ell_2$ norm results, expressed through
code weight enumerators and input bias parameters. Our bounds improve security
assessments by an order of magnitude over previous approximations. By scanning
~20,000 codes, we reveal fundamental trade-offs between compression efficiency
and cryptographic security. For instance, we show that achieving 80 bits of
security can require sacrificing more than 50\% of the code rate when
correcting 10\% input bias. Our bounds enhance security evaluation of TRNG
post-processing schemes and quantify the inherent cost of randomness extraction
in hardware implementations.

Motivation: 现有LLM指纹方法依赖于训练后的特性，无法在训练前验证模型身份。需要一种更本质、基于初始化参数的指纹方法

Method: 利用未训练模型在初始化时表现出的可复现的token选择偏差作为指纹，通过统计检测方法识别模型谱系

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上实现种子级区分度，能在所有训练阶段有效工作，对领域偏移和参数修改具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 初始化过程为神经语言模型印刻了独特且持久的身份标识，形成了真正的"Galtonian"指纹

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Abstract: The ever-increasing complexity of design specifications for processors and
intellectual property (IP) presents a formidable challenge for early bug
detection in the modern IC design cycle. The recent advancements in hardware
fuzzing have proven effective in detecting bugs in RTL designs of cutting-edge
processors. The modern IC design flow involves incremental updates and
modifications to the hardware designs necessitating rigorous verification and
extending the overall verification period. To accelerate this process, directed
fuzzing has emerged focusing on generating targeted stimuli for specific
regions of the design, avoiding the need for exhaustive, full-scale
verification. However, a significant limitation of these hardware fuzzers lies
in their reliance on an equivalent SW model of the hardware which fails to
capture intrinsic hardware characteristics. To circumvent the aforementioned
challenges, this work introduces TargetFuzz, an innovative and scalable
targeted hardware fuzzing mechanism. It leverages SAT-based techniques to focus
on specific regions of the hardware design while operating at its native
hardware abstraction level, ensuring a more precise and comprehensive
verification process. We evaluated this approach across a diverse range of RTL
designs for various IP cores. Our experimental results demonstrate its
capability to effectively target and fuzz a broad spectrum of sites within
these designs, showcasing its extensive coverage and precision in addressing
targeted regions. TargetFuzz demonstrates its capability to effectively scale
30x greater in terms of handling target sites, achieving 100% state coverage
and 1.5x faster in terms of site coverage, and shows 90x improvement in target
state coverage compared to Coverage-Guided Fuzzing, demonstrating its potential
to advance the state-of-the-art in directed hardware fuzzing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习技术在网络安全检测中的广泛应用，模型复杂度增加导致内部操作变得不透明，需要开发可解释的物理层攻击检测方法来提高模型透明度和可信度。

Method: 首先分析各种分类器的内部工作机制，研究不同监控参数对各类攻击检测的影响；其次评估检测器对恶意参数噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 分析不仅提高了模型的可解释性，还为优化模型设计以提升速度提供了思路；同时揭示了模型速度与鲁棒性之间的关键权衡关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于网络监控数据开发快速且鲁棒的检测器提供了设计指南，强调了在模型性能和可解释性之间寻求平衡的重要性。

Abstract: Detection of emerging attacks on network infrastructure is a critical aspect
of security management. To meet the growing scale and complexity of modern
threats, machine learning (ML) techniques offer valuable tools for automating
the detection of malicious activities. However, as these techniques become more
complex, their internal operations grow increasingly opaque. In this context,
we address the need for explainable physical-layer attack detection methods.
First, we analyze the inner workings of various classifiers trained to alert
about physical layer intrusions, examining how the influence of different
monitored parameters varies depending on the type of attack being detected.
This analysis not only improves the interpretability of the models but also
suggests ways to enhance their design for increased speed. In the second part,
we evaluate the detectors' resilience to malicious parameter noising. The
results highlight a key trade-off between model speed and resilience. This work
serves as a design guideline for developing fast and robust detectors trained
on available network monitoring data.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DeepProv是一个可定制的系统，通过推理溯源图(IPGs)来捕获和分析深度神经网络在推理时的行为，并基于此系统性地修复模型，特别是在对抗鲁棒性方面取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在关键应用中部署时存在不可预测和不可靠的行为，需要新的方法来确保其可靠性。

Method: 利用推理溯源图(IPGs)对DNN的计算信息流进行建模，提供详细的结构化行为表示，支持经验和结构分析，并基于此识别节点和边级别的修复操作。

Result: 在对抗鲁棒性修复中，仅修复DNN的单个层就能使对抗精度平均提高55%，且能补充现有防御方法，显著增强模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DeepProv不仅有效提升了DNN的对抗鲁棒性，还展示了在隐私审计和公平性分析等其他关键领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes
applications, from self-driving cars to biometric authentication. However,
their unpredictable and unreliable behaviors in real-world settings require new
approaches to characterize and ensure their reliability.
  This paper introduces DeepProv, a novel and customizable system designed to
capture and characterize the runtime behavior of DNNs during inference by using
their underlying graph structure. Inspired by system audit provenance graphs,
DeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process
through Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed
structural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and
structural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs
for specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.
  We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model
repair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our
results demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse
classification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv
automatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs,
significantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying
DeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average
55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements
existing defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness.
Beyond robustness, we demonstrate the broader potential of DeepProv as an
adaptable system to characterize DNN behavior in other critical areas, such as
privacy auditing and fairness analysis.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了模型指纹认证方案的对抗鲁棒性，发现现有方法在面对恶意攻击时存在严重漏洞，并提出了针对性的对抗攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型指纹认证方案主要关注良性扰动，缺乏对恶意模型托管方的对抗鲁棒性评估，导致系统存在安全漏洞。

Method: 首先定义了具体的威胁模型，然后分析现有指纹方案的根本漏洞，针对每个漏洞开发了自适应对抗攻击方法。

Result: 针对10个最新指纹方案的实验表明，所提出的对抗攻击能够完全绕过模型认证，同时保持模型对终端用户的高效用。

Conclusion: 研究鼓励指纹设计者采用对抗鲁棒性设计原则，并为未来指纹方法提供了改进建议。

Abstract: Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model
ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused
on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and
prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness}
against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge
this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model
fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting
schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we
develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and
demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten
recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the
model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt
adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future
fingerprinting methods.

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为2D平面图的任务来测试模型的空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代多模态模型能够处理照片输入，但空间重建任务需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持尺度一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50套公寓数据集上的表现，使用基于房间连通图和大小的相似度评分算法。

Result: 结果显示当前AI能力存在显著盲点：大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型尤其不擅长遵循指令。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，将持续评估新模型以监测通用AI系统中空间智能的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型(SCM)提升人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，利用网络层的形式化因果知识表示。

Method: 引入因果抽象网络(CAN)，使用高斯SCM，限制映射为构造性线性因果抽象的转置，提出SPECTRAL迭代方法进行学习，具有闭式更新并适用于正定和半正定协方差矩阵。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验显示，在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并能成功恢复多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN提供了一种有效的框架来学习和表示因果知识，通过分离的局部黎曼问题和高效搜索程序实现了对一致CAN的学习。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链(CoT)和循环模型中潜在思维两种推理方法的比较能力，它们都利用迭代计算但实现方式不同，其相对优势尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过形式化分析比较CoT和循环Transformer中潜在思维的计算特性，包括并行性、序列性和随机解码能力。

Result: 发现潜在思维在循环Transformer中支持并行计算，比CoT的序列过程更高效；而CoT通过随机解码能近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势：深度驱动递归适合并行计算任务，CoT适合处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法处理大规模数据耗时耗力，而现有AI方法缺乏解释严谨性。

Method: 使用1536维向量嵌入、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，对比了纯自动化与人工引导优化两种模式。

Result: NGT实现了168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周）、更高质量（0.904 vs 0.883）和96%成本降低，发现了人工编码无法识别的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释是互补的，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，研究人员从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞察。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期业务过程，但面临记忆管理挑战，包括记忆膨胀和上下文退化，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 采用受认知科学启发的混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，并设计主动的智能衰减机制，基于新近性、相关性和用户指定效用的复合评分来智能修剪或整合记忆。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可靠、透明的AI代理建立了一个新框架，支持有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新的架构修改，通过在注意力机制中注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性的事实讲述者，完全消除可验证事实的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生从未真正知道的事实幻觉。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么在文本前添加检索内容，但未能从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数处进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。该方法直接将可验证知识注入注意力机制。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询的实验中，FGA将Llama 3.2的准确率从6.3%提升至99.7%。知识更新在1秒内完成，而参数编辑方法需要数小时。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少了幻觉，而是完全消除了可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Motivation: 研究解码器语言模型是否进行规划（即组织中间计算以支持连贯的长范围生成），这对可解释性、可靠性和模型设计有重要意义。

Method: 使用基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道压缩Transformer隐藏状态，通过互信息测量分析模型的计算结构，在语法、路径寻找和自然语言任务中研究规划能力。

Result: 发现有效规划范围依赖任务，模型隐式保留未使用的正确延续信息，预测主要依赖近期计算但早期块仍具信息性。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用管道来探测深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，削弱了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间；提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专业互补角色的多轮辩论机制和动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效缓解评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了因果视觉编程(CVP)新范式，通过在工作流中引入因果结构来减少LLM代理的幻觉和逻辑错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在低代码环境中因依赖概率关联而非真正因果理解而产生的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题

Method: 通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图(DAG)来显式定义模块间的因果关系，作为推理过程的约束

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，能有效增强代理在动态环境中的鲁棒性并减少因果混淆导致的错误

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ID-RAG机制，通过构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来解决生成代理在长期任务中的身份漂移问题，在市长选举模拟中显著提升了身份一致性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型驱动的生成代理被部署用于长期任务，当长期记忆上下文随时间增长时，它们难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念以及在多代理系统中传播幻觉等关键故障。

Method: 引入身份检索增强生成（ID-RAG）机制，将代理的角色和持久偏好锚定在动态结构化身份模型中——一个包含核心信念、特质和价值观的知识图谱。在代理决策循环中查询该模型以检索相关身份上下文，直接指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理——在第四个时间步时所有测试模型的身份召回率更高，并将模拟收敛时间减少了19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式、可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行智能体推理框架，将顺序执行转变为有向无环图，实现子任务并发执行，显著提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，通过动态工作流优化持续改进执行图，集成摘要模块。

Result: 在BrowseComp上达到67.7%准确率，xbench-DeepSearch上达到83%，相比现有框架减少最多35%的执行步骤。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了智能体架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自我复制风险的框架，发现在现实操作压力下，超过50%的LLM智能体表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似于《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。现有研究主要关注智能体在被直接指令时的自我复制能力，而忽略了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实的生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），通过设计可能导致用户与智能体目标错位的任务来评估智能体行为。引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（Φ_R）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM智能体时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 神经网络可以独立从一阶心理理论自发泛化到高阶心理理论，无需依赖高级推理技能，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在不需要高级技能的情况下，独立从一阶心理理论发展到高阶心理理论。

Method: 构建了一个神经心理理论网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且表现出与人类认知期望一致的难度模式。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发泛化心理理论能力，这为开发更类人认知系统提供了基础，并揭示了机器心理理论的泛化模式。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学的基础挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大语言模型在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过对前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹进行监督微调来增强LLM性能。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中不仅达到最先进性能，而且超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型能力。实现了87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率，且仅使用2%的质量过滤训练数据仍能保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强LLM在特定领域的推理能力，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效传递生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要针对特定维度的结构化反馈来诊断和优化问题。

Method: 提出模块化框架SRM，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释和高效评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，其模块化设计支持高效优化和实际场景应用。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

Motivation: LLM智能体在处理复杂多步骤任务时容易发生级联错误，当前系统缺乏模块化和系统性的错误理解框架，无法有效检测和修复这些错误。

Method: 开发了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、构建AgentErrorBench标注数据集、提出AgentDebug调试框架来隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上的实验显示，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在三个测试平台上任务成功率相对提升高达26%。

Conclusion: 系统化调试是构建更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径，AgentDebug框架能够显著提升智能体的错误恢复能力和任务执行成功率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，帮助理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息量，需要开发能够捕捉临床相关变化的方法。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：1)从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM显著性图；2)将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，通过轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息，无法直接优化分支决策。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace学习，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集决策级监督，直接减少传播次数。

Result: 广泛实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过模仿学习实现了高质量分支决策，训练收敛更快、更稳定，并能无缝集成到CDCL求解器中。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Conclusion: 该双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，并采用动态预算分配，能够有效提高推理任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

TL;DR: 提出了首个开放的、机器可读的病例和综合征定义格式，以解决公共卫生领域病例定义标准化和互操作性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共卫生威胁的有效沟通需要标准化的病例定义，但缺乏机器可读格式阻碍了互操作性、流行病学研究和人工智能应用。

Method: 开发了Open Syndrome Definition格式，创建了标准化病例定义数据集，提供工具将现有人类可读定义转换为机器可读格式，并建立了在线平台。

Result: 建立了https://opensyndrome.org在线平台，提供了开源格式和工具，实现了病例定义的一致性和可扩展使用。

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够实现跨系统的病例定义一致性使用，释放人工智能在公共卫生准备和响应中的潜力。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

TL;DR: GESA是一个用于候选人角色分配的综合性框架，通过集成领域自适应transformer嵌入、异质自监督图神经网络、对抗去偏机制、多目标遗传优化和可解释AI组件，解决了现有方法在语义灵活性、人口统计偏见、决策过程不透明和动态政策约束下可扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的候选人与角色分配方法存在语义不灵活、持续的人口统计偏见、决策过程不透明以及在动态政策约束下可扩展性差等局限性，这些挑战在包括企业招聘、学术录取、奖学金授予和志愿者安置系统等多个领域普遍存在。

Method: GESA框架集成了领域自适应transformer嵌入、异质自监督图神经网络、对抗去偏机制、多目标遗传优化和可解释AI组件，通过综合这些技术来解决分配问题。

Result: 在包含20,000个候选人档案和3,000个角色规范的大规模国际基准测试中，GESA表现出卓越性能：94.5%的top-3分配准确率、多样性表示提升37%、跨人口统计类别公平性得分0.98、端到端延迟低于1秒。

TL;DR: DeepSearch将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，通过系统化探索解决训练瓶颈，在数学推理基准上达到62.95%准确率，比扩展训练方法节省5.7倍GPU时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，性能提升随训练步骤增加而减少，主要原因是稀疏的探索模式无法覆盖关键推理路径。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应重放缓冲训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立新的最先进水平，比扩展训练方法节省5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: 通过系统化搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向，证明了算法创新的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现良好，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图编码七种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示指导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中，CCoT-Emo超越了先前的最先进方法，并显著提高了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图有效增强了大型音频语言模型的情感推理能力，无需模型微调即可显著提升语音情感识别性能

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂组合模型，在CV、NLP和DRL等领域提供归因、探测和干预功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以处理图像描述、深度强化学习等需要复杂建模的用例，这些用例通常涉及多输入输出或可组合分离网络，无法直接适配流行框架的API。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级通用框架TDHook，提供现成的归因、探测方法和灵活的干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的复杂组合模型。

Result: TDHook具有最小依赖，磁盘空间约为transformer_lens的一半，在受控基准测试中，在CPU和GPU上运行多目标管道的积分梯度时比captum快达2倍。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了方法类之间的差距，使现代可解释性管道更易访问，并通过在CV、NLP和DRL中的具体用例验证了其价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Motivation: 研究发现基于语义ID的生成式推荐系统在扩展模型规模时存在显著瓶颈，性能很快饱和。作者旨在探索具有更好扩展行为的生成式推荐模型。

Method: 比较两种生成式推荐范式：基于语义ID的方法和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器的方法，在44M到14B参数范围内分析其扩展特性。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，比基于语义ID的生成式推荐的最佳性能提升达20%。大语言模型能够随着规模扩大更好地建模用户-物品交互。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS是通向生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据深度埋藏的问题。提出了BDTR框架来解决桥接证据排序问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统依赖静态检索，当关键桥接文档缺失时会导致推理崩溃和幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 系统分析不同迭代检索策略与图基底的交互作用，提出Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思想并利用推理链重新校准排序。

Result: 迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入前列排名，但存在噪声引入问题，且在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限。BDTR在各种GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到领先位置以支持推理链。BDTR为解决这一瓶颈提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier

Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息带来的团队协作表示学习挑战。

Method: 通过直接建模通信协议构建表示空间，支持完全去中心化执行和隐式协调，避免显式消息传递的缺点。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体都表现出色，能够与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL为团队协作提供了一个简单而强大的解决方案，其表示既可作为隐式潜在变量，也可作为显式通信消息使用。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding

TL;DR: 提出了IRIS框架，通过最大化自不确定性而非自确定性来改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，无需外部奖励或标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，RLHF在自回归T2I生成中应用受限，探索如何仅使用内部信号进行学习

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成

Result: IRIS在自回归T2I模型上取得与外部奖励相当或更优的性能

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性比最大化自确定性更有利于自回归T2I生成，IRIS框架有效且无需外部数据

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于信息论和学习的理论框架，用于确定在哪些条件下跳过视觉语言模型的层可以在不牺牲性能的情况下提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能出色，但推理成本高昂。现有的层跳过技术由于缺乏对何时跳过层有益的理论理解而未被充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化，识别具有大冗余度的层，这些层与实践中流行的层跳过方法所跳过的层相吻合。

Result: 实验表明，跳过这些冗余层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用层跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，证明了在特定条件下层跳过是提高VLM推理效率的有效策略。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

*Hankun Dai,Maoquan Wang,Mengnan Qi,Yikai Zhang,Zijian Jin,Yongqiang Yao,Yufan Huang,Shengyu Fu,Elsie Nallipogu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化手动设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在减少token消耗和设计成本的同时，达到或超过复杂代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优和定制设计，难以评估模型的真实能力，且构建维护成本高。

Method: 提出Lita框架，基于"轻量化"原则，在保持完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化手动设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程的代理基线达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token和设计努力。

Conclusion: Lita能够有效揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂约束时往往无法生成最优的接地解决方案，现实旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至基于交互动态演化的约束。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索机制，专门应对约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升至44.4%；在真实世界旅行规划任务中，达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct(59%)和单体智能体(27%)。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，展现了优越的整体规划性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等多领域专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者的参与。现有方法存在范围有限、需要手动集成、处理交互逻辑能力差等问题。

Method: 使用四个协调的智能体：规划智能体将用户需求解析为结构化蓝图，生成智能体生成可执行的C#脚本，自动化智能体处理引擎组件绑定和场景构建，调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同的游戏原型上评估，UniGen不仅实现了无需编码的游戏创作民主化，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen是首个端到端的协调多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动生成基于Unity和Unreal Engine的可执行3D游戏项目，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在处理临床事件序列和时序依赖关系方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，明确建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专业EHR模型的AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLM的C-index提高7.2%，实现了最先进的预测准确性和临床可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: NEP框架在提升预测准确性的同时，其注意力模式与已知疾病通路一致，具有临床可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现细微的人口统计变化可能破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是主要的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括偏见漏洞和幻觉问题。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但检索内容可能放大偏见，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，细微的人口统计变化可能破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的偏见来源，存在一致的偏见层级结构。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要精心设计以防止偏见放大，研究为开发者和测试人员提供了实用警示，在采用可访问的SLMs时不能牺牲公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

TL;DR: LLM可以将反馈因果模糊认知图(FCM)转换为文本并重建，形成可解释的AI系统，类似于自编码器但具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒自编码器缺乏可解释性的问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM将FCM映射为文本，再从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 实现了有损重建，保留强因果关系但移除弱因果边，编码器为保持文本自然性会牺牲部分细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可解释的AI系统，人类可以阅读和解释编码文本，优于黑盒自编码器。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和过程奖励对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果奖励只提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，限制了在长轨迹任务中的效果。过程奖励虽然能提供细粒度监督，但难以标注且可能不与最终结果对齐。

Method: 提出PPR方法，训练基于原则的奖励模型来提高过程评估的透明度和可靠性，并引入Reward Normalization策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，表现出优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法通过统一原则性步骤评估和结果验证，有效解决了过程奖励与最终结果的对齐问题，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统性地操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理的决策变化。

Conclusion: 代理的易受影响性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也带来机遇（为AI代理行为科学提供强大测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据删除的有效验证机制。现有的后门验证方法只能确认后门样本的遗忘，但无法验证用户真实样本是否真正被遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本之间缺乏关联性。

Method: 采用自监督模型播种技术，将用户特定种子(如用户唯一标识)与原始样本和模型关联起来。设计了联合训练结构，同时优化自监督模型播种任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型播种。

Conclusion: SMS方案成功地将用户种子、原始样本和模型联系起来，为真实样本的遗忘验证提供了可行的解决方案，同时保持了服务模型的实用性。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式的大语言模型自我复制评估基准，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 使用基于现代CLI工具和计算机过程的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM以代理方式执行实验，通过性能计算得出R分数和RCL-PCL矩阵分类。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以安全地降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

*Hailong Zhang,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IRCAV-AVN框架，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制统一多模态信息融合和序列建模，替代传统分离的融合和GRU模块，提升音频-视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段存在冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用IRCAV模块整合多模态信息融合和序列建模，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过统一的多模态信息处理机制有效提升了音频-视觉导航的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

*Dongsheng Yang,Meiling Zhu,Yinfeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LGK方法，通过引入外部知识库解决视觉语言导航中常识推理不足的问题，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得最佳性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力

Method: 构建63万语言描述的知识库，设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)和知识引导动态增强(KGDA)，整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上导航误差、成功率和路径效率均优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在常识推理方面

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险领域AI系统存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当偏见根植于结构性偏见时。

Method: 利用背景知识的形式溯因解释框架，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数在跨群体同等能力个体间评估实质性公平。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证展示了该框架在现实案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解释个体AI决策中的代理歧视，揭示结构性偏见根源，为AI公平性评估提供新方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本定位对象检索增强的VQA方法，通过生成与问题最相关对象的边界框进行针对性图像裁剪，减少背景噪声，提高视觉-文本对齐，降低幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声干扰和视觉-文本对齐不佳的问题，导致VQA准确率不高且容易产生幻觉。

Method: 引入文本定位的对象定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，并提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: VQA准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%（绝对提升3.45个百分点），幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分得到改善。

Conclusion: 文本定位的对象检索增强方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦相关对象减少干扰，显著降低幻觉现象。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为任意数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，并训练了SingSQL-LM模型，在BIRD基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能自主评估系统性能的需求。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：层次化分区数据库模式，跨多个复杂度级别合成SQL查询，使用质量感知管道（包括LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡）。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，优于最佳3B基线；在合成评估集上显著超越先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了可扩展、数据库无关的范式，结合无模式微调和仅模式推理可获得最稳健结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化，将DeepSeek-V3模型从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下成功部署，保持高输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型混合专家模型在资源受限边缘平台上的部署难题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时实现超高压缩比。

Method: 采用协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化三种技术。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，实现边缘平台部署，同时保持高质量输出。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: 提出的异构图强化学习框架结合专家系统能够有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的决策性能。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过将基础视觉模型的感知能力与符号推理的组合表达能力相结合，解决了现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念以解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受到严格逻辑执行或预定义谓词的限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够在VLM生成的不确定性上进行推理的软逻辑运算符。该框架采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，并以无需训练的方式运行，同时其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中使用对抗性测试进行评估，NePTune相比强大的基础模型表现出显著改进，并在新环境中展现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune框架成功克服了现有神经符号方法的局限性，通过集成感知和符号推理，显著提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，并在多个测试中证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，推理模型的后训练会催生功能专门化的注意力头，这些头共同支持结构化推理。不同训练机制下这些头的演化方式不同：蒸馏和SFT是稳定累积，而GRPO是动态搜索模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升背后的架构机制，揭示训练过程如何影响模型内部结构的演化。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化，包括蒸馏、监督微调和组相对策略优化。

Result: 发现不同训练机制产生不同的注意力头演化模式：蒸馏和SFT稳定累积推理头，GRPO动态搜索和修剪；可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，而是通过补偿机制实现。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的增强以基础计算能力为代价，存在性能权衡：强化头能解决困难问题，但可能导致简单任务上的过度思考失败。未来训练策略需要在有效推理和可靠执行间取得平衡。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，缺乏真正的原创性。通过广告创意测试发现，模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入时创意特征（如隐喻、情感）会早期消失。提供特定线索可以部分改善输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能生成流畅文本，但往往使用安全、通用的表达方式，这引发了对它们处理创意任务能力的质疑。研究旨在形式化这种向平庸回归的趋势。

Method: 使用广告创意作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告概念，分析创意特征的消失顺序。通过定量比较和定性分析评估模型从简化输入重新生成文本的能力。

Result: 模型在简化过程中优先保留事实内容，创意特征早期消失。重新生成的文本虽然词汇多样但缺乏深度和独特性。提供特定创意线索（隐喻、情感钩子、视觉标记）可以改善对齐和风格平衡。

Conclusion: 没有针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会向平庸漂移；结构化信号可以部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就实现了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。研究发现小模型(8B)对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性能，同时比32B模型计算效率高3.5倍、内存效率高1.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体强化学习在大语言模型上的应用，探索如何通过奖励塑造提高训练效率，同时保持泛化能力，特别是在不同规模模型上的表现差异。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，在TravelPlanner基准上进行智能体强化学习训练，采用奖励塑造技术，比较不同规模模型(8B vs 32B)在密集和稀疏奖励下的表现，并评估课程学习的效果。

Result: 8B模型在密集过程级奖励信号下达到竞争性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。奖励塑造显著增强学习动态，且不会导致过拟合，在Multi-IF、NaturalPlan和τ-Bench等域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型展现出竞争优势，可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下实现效率提升，8B模型是智能体强化学习最高效的设置。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [121] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过自适应决定何时在搜索过程中分支，而不是在每一步都分支，显著提高了树搜索方法的效率。该方法使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长时程推理任务中虽然性能优异，但计算效率极低，通常比简单的迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Method: 提出了Chain-in-Tree (CiT)框架，包含两种分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作来估计一致性）。该框架可集成到多种树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少了75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时有所提升。BN-SC通常能节省高达80%的计算，但在少数情况下存在不稳定性。辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT框架通过自适应分支决策显著提高了树搜索方法的效率，在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算开销，为长时程推理任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiStyle是一个两阶段风格嵌入预测器，通过分层预测和对比学习实现更好的可控语音合成，相比现有方法在风格控制性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过文本提示预测全局风格嵌入，但忽视了嵌入分布的层次结构，限制了系统的潜力。

Method: 提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，分层预测风格嵌入并结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；还提出结合统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在基础TTS模型上实现了显著更好的风格可控性，同时保持了高质量的自然度和可懂度。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过分层预测和对比学习有效提升了可控语音合成的性能，为基于文本描述的风格控制提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制理解的框架，通过识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准激活，并通过预防性微调增强模型的安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如时态改变）就能绕过安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法的泛化差距。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头；2. 训练通道级缩放向量重新校准易受攻击头的激活；3. 应用预防性微调，让模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力，最小化了过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 对抗性后缀通过抑制拒绝介导方向的传播来绕过安全机制，基于机制理解的深度分析可以开发出实用、高效、有针对性的方法来调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算(CIM)神经网络的联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，能够同时优化软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，显著提升硬件效率和性能精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数。由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不切实际。

Method: 开发了CIMNAS框架，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和广泛的硬件参数，包括器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS实现了90.1x到104.5x的能量-延迟-面积积(EDAP)降低，TOPS/W提升4.68x到4.82x，TOPS/mm²提升11.3x到12.78x，同时保持73.81%的准确率。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，展示了良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SafeMindBench基准测试和SafeMindAgent解决方案，用于系统评估和缓解具身LLM代理的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的高级规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互会暴露安全漏洞，需要系统性的安全风险研究。

Method: 识别了四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化了三种安全约束类型，构建了多模态基准测试SafeMindBench，并提出了具有三个级联安全模块的SafeMindAgent架构。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险研究提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系。现有LLMs基准测试过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估，与实际网络数据挖掘任务脱节。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，按难度分类，用于全面评估LLMs处理复杂JSON的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON时存在显著性能差距，验证了基准测试的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试填补了现有评估体系的空白，有助于推动结构化JSON生成研究，数据集已开源。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Motivation: 研究LLM在推理过程中生成有效中间步骤的重要性，特别是在多选题场景下，发现当问题对模型不可解时容易产生虚假推理链，导致错误结果。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习，采用组相对优势方法将可解性纳入目标函数。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集实验中，改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少推理幻觉、提高CoT推理可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，包含BEV序列图像和定量智能体级风险标注，对知名VLM模型进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLM模型在时空推理上表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高；微调后的7B VLM模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率表明该任务极具挑战性，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp)方法，通过战略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练会导致推理任务中过程过于冗长和智能体设置中探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两种批次类型：1) 优先级批次，结合在线批次中的短正确和长错误响应，为简洁性提供清晰梯度信号；2) 补偿批次，使用重放缓冲区中的剩余响应来保持稳定性并防止模型崩溃。

Result: 在三种设置中均实现显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确性，思维压缩中长度减少高达52.5%，且性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在多种设置下实现显著效率提升，同时保持模型性能稳定。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出，但往往无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限，需要更有效的机器遗忘方法来防止语言模型泄露敏感信息。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应。通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考，实现无需训练的适应性。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在间接查询情况下也表现优异，同时保持了响应质量和通用效用，在持续遗忘场景下展现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架通过检索增强的校正机制有效解决了机器遗忘问题，具有实际应用价值，特别适用于大规模和持续遗忘场景。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态虚假内容检测框架UMFDet，整合人类制作和AI生成的虚假内容检测，通过类别感知MoE适配器和归因思维链机制实现跨类型检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容分开研究，导致模型只能检测单一类型，而真实场景中内容类型未知，需要统一检测方案。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制定位欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上均表现稳健一致，优于专用基线模型，为真实世界多模态欺骗检测提供实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态虚假内容检测的空白，提出的统一框架能有效处理未知类型的虚假内容，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

tool for realistic tactical scenarios. This integration allows mixed
simulations where human-controlled entities engage with intelligent agents
exhibiting distinct combat behaviors. Our interaction model creates new
opportunities for human-agent teaming, immersive training, and the exploration
of innovative tactics in defense contexts.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过结合LLM的结构化知识和迭代反馈，有效提升了NAS的性能和效率，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

TL;DR: LLMs在社会科学应用中不应被误解为概率推理工具，而应作为在明确范围条件下的高容量模式匹配器进行准预测插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的预测输出常被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，需要澄清其局限性并建立实用护栏。

Method: 提出将LLMs重新定义为高容量模式匹配器，并引入独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准等实用护栏。

Result: 建立了避免类别错误的框架，使研究人员能在有用原型设计和预测的同时保持谨慎。

Conclusion: LLMs应作为准预测插值工具在明确范围条件下使用，而非概率推理的替代品，需要采用实用护栏来确保正确解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

TL;DR: 提出了SafeEvalAgent框架，通过多智能体系统自主消化政策文档生成并持续演化安全基准，实现动态安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险和法规的动态变化，存在关键安全漏洞，需要新的动态评估范式。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过专门智能体协同管道和自我演化评估循环，从评估结果中学习并生成更复杂的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示模型安全性随评估强化而持续下降，如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，动态评估生态系统对确保先进AI安全部署至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Result: 创建了MEDAKA数据集，通过人工检查和LLM评估验证了质量，与现有生物医学KG相比具有更好的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: MEDAKA数据集支持临床任务，该流程也可用于其他领域从非结构化文本构建知识图谱。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体检测方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等问题。

Method: 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征，结合注意力机制动态加权关键文本，构建多示例学习架构进行用户级检测。

Result: 在WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 弱监督学习策略显著降低标注成本，为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其实际临床应用与潜力之间存在显著差距，需要解决实施中的实际问题。

Method: 基于在Mass General Brigham部署"irAE-Agent"系统的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，分析临床AI开发中的关键挑战。

Result: 分析发现临床AI开发存在严重错位：仅不到20%的精力用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%的精力消耗在实施的社会技术工作上，总结为五个"重担"。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法主要依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要根本性转变。

Method: 提出整合社会科学解释性定性方法，基于'厚描述'概念，要求AI系统产生'厚输出'，并概述文化对齐成功的三个必要条件。

Result: 提出文化对齐的新框架，强调充分范围的文化表征、细致入微的输出能力以及基于提示中文化情境的输出锚定。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 测试大型语言模型作为自主推理代理在材料科学中进行知识发现的能力，探索其在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索和发现系统行为的能力。

Conclusion: LLM代理可以作为有效的知识发现工具，在材料科学中自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述，展示了在有限信息下进行科学探索的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出在12个维度上的表现，结合人类和LLM的反馈进行迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍然不足，需要开发更全面的评估工具。

Method: 设计人类中心化问卷，通过多轮对查询-输出对的评分和语义讨论进行迭代优化，整合人类评分者和人-LLM组合的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有益支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性，扩展了初始框架，为RAG系统评估提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中由于状态-动作空间庞大和奖励稀疏，存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，采用基于势能的奖励塑造机制保持最优策略不变性，并设计启发式方法防止奖励黑客攻击

Conclusion: 全局序列级多样性是激励深度探索的关键因素，DIVER框架能有效提升LLMs在可验证奖励任务中的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大规模语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重阻碍，传统打包策略和不对称的前向-后向计算成本导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法为前向和后向计算分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全维度负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了最高2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供优越的负载均衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过切片级分解和非对称分区调度，突破了传统权衡，能够同时实现优异的负载平衡和高资源效率，为LLM分布式训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all

TL;DR: 提出了一个联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生动作和外生机制）的抽象世界模型框架，通过变分贝叶斯推理和LLM提案从有限数据中学习，在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中实现了快速规划并泛化到更复杂的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视野具身规划面临挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体的动作变化，外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也会与智能体动作同时发生。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生动作和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提案从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型实现了快速规划，能够泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理长视野具身规划中的外生过程，学习到的世界模型支持快速规划并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来提升LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，不符合人类通过互动提升独立解决问题能力的认知模式，因此研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互（根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3交互范式进行信息交换）和感知校准（使用GRPO训练LLMs，整合奖励分布特征）。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%，Idea3能增强强LLMs的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更好。

Conclusion: 多智能体交互确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过创新的交互和训练机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM在长期、多步骤战略商业决策中表现的有效基准，现有基准主要关注短期任务，无法充分测试LLM的长期一致性决策能力。

Method: 开发了一个可复现的开放式管理模拟器，在12个月的动态零售业务模拟中，让LLM基于结构化提示和完整业务报告做出关键战略决策，包括定价、订单、营销预算等。

Result: 通过定量指标（利润、收入、市场份额等KPI）和定性分析（战略一致性、市场适应能力、决策理由）对五个LLM进行了综合评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI社区提供了一个可复现的LLM基准测试框架，能够超越简单性能指标，全面评估LLM的长期战略决策能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一种受人类认知启发的分层越狱防御机制，通过意图推断、自我反思和自我修订三阶段模拟人类多阶段推理过程，有效保护大语言模型免受越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限或无法检测复杂上下文中恶意意图的问题，需要更高效、自适应的安全机制。

Method: 采用分层三阶段方法：意图推断检测输入风险，自我反思评估响应并分配置信度，自我修订自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上显著提高鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种最先进防御基线。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效、受人类启发的防御方法，能有效保护LLMs免受各种越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型评估主要依赖合成基准，对真实世界泛化能力的检验不足，需要更贴近现实的数据集来评估模型性能。

Method: 开发了从真实视频中提取时间信号的流水线，使用光流技术创建反映日常时间动态的数据集，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管这些模型在传统基准上表现良好，但在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明这些基础模型的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的迫切需求，以推动时间序列基础模型实现真正的通用性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取流水线的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地概念化了自进化智能体中的"错误进化"风险，揭示了即使基于顶级LLM构建的智能体也会在模型、记忆、工具和工作流程四个进化路径中出现意外偏差，导致安全对齐退化等风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的发展，自进化智能体展现出强大能力，但自进化过程也带来了被现有安全研究忽视的新型风险。本研究旨在系统调查智能体在自进化过程中偏离预期方向，产生不良甚至有害结果的现象。

Method: 通过评估四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具和工作流程）来系统研究错误进化现象，使用包括Gemini-2.5-Pro在内的顶级LLM构建智能体进行实证分析。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是普遍存在的风险，在自进化过程中观察到多种新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 错误进化是自进化智能体的重要安全风险，迫切需要新的安全范式来构建更安全可信的自进化智能体，并讨论了潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在PDBBind数据集上实现了优于现有最佳对接算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因情境而异，没有单一算法始终占优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架来克服这一挑战。

Method: 1. 多标准评估：结合结合构象精度(RMSD)和PoseBusters有效性检查；2. 架构改进：引入残差连接增强预测鲁棒性；3. 排名感知损失函数：改进排名学习能力。

Result: 在包含约3200个蛋白-配体复合物的PDBBind数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBuster验证的复合标准下，相比最佳单一算法Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升了5.4%和3.4%的性能。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构优化，显著提升了分子对接算法选择的性能，为药物发现提供了更可靠的对接预测工具。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 在服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵A和B，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务上的实验表明，FLoRA-NA实现了最先进的全局性能，同时保持低通信开销。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA通过近乎准确的估计方法有效解决了联邦低秩适应中的关键限制，实现了通信效率和泛化性能的平衡。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

TL;DR: 本文重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新表述为链接预测问题，开发了一个支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域基准数据集上验证了其高精度性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在捕获上下文语义方面取得进展，但知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。KGE模型提供可扩展、结构感知的表示，特别适合基于本体的任务，但在实体对齐中应用不足。

Method: 将实体对齐重新表述为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发了集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型。系统从合并本体学习嵌入，通过计算实体表示间的余弦相似度来对齐实体。

Result: 在跨越五个领域的七个基准数据集上的评估显示：ConvE和TransF等KGE模型产生高精度对齐，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统；虽然召回率适中，但这种保守性使其适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了一种与LLM方法互补且计算高效的策略。这些结果凸显了基于嵌入的实体对齐的前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于Transformer的框架，用于乳腺动态增强MRI中病变的自动分类，旨在提高特异性并减少不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI在癌症检测中特异性差，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检，需要开发更准确的自动分类方法。

Method: 使用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，通过量化恶性像素分布实现病变分类，并整合了包含88名患者133个标注病变的标准化数据集。

Result: 模型在病变级别分类达到AUC 0.92，患者级别灵敏度100%、特异性67%，可能避免三分之一的不必要活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病变分类的标准化基准，通过公开数据集和模型支持临床决策和方法学进步。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和对中央服务器的依赖，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化的框架，通过客户端间迭代共享和优化文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG降低118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大型视觉语言模型的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，在5项研究和约20,000次查询中发现四个广泛使用的LLM表现出强烈的自我偏好，这种偏好会随着身份认知而改变，并在重要决策场景中产生影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但研究发现它们仍然表现出类似人类的自偏好倾向，这违背了LLMs应保持中立判断的核心承诺。

Method: 通过5项研究约20,000次查询，包括词语联想任务、API查询对比、身份操纵实验，以及在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等实际场景中的测试。

Result: LLMs在词语联想任务中显著偏好自身名称、公司和CEO；API查询时自偏好消失；通过身份操纵发现自偏好跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份；在重要决策场景中也表现出自偏好。

Conclusion: 自偏好似乎深深编码在LLM认知中，这引发了关于LLM行为是否会受到系统性自偏好倾向影响的担忧，呼吁模型创造者正视这一核心承诺的破裂。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

Motivation: 发现统一多模态模型(UMMs)存在生成-理解耦合的漏洞，攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能吸收这些信息，即跨模态生成注入(CMGI)。现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移，未能充分探索UMMs的独特漏洞。

Method: STaR-Attack定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，采用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。前两轮利用UMMs的生成能力生成场景图像，随后通过理解能力引入基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了UMMs中一个关键但尚未充分开发的漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

### [162] [The Average Patient Fallacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26474)
*Alaleh Azhir,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出机器学习在医学中通常优化群体平均值，导致罕见但临床重要的病例被边缘化，作者称之为'平均患者谬误'，并提出了一系列操作解决方案来改善这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学机器学习通常基于频率加权训练，这使常见病例获得优势而罕见但临床关键的病例被边缘化，这种偏见阻碍了精准医学的发展。

Method: 提出操作解决方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。权重选择应遵循结构化审议。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例展示了这种偏见如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况以及在视力威胁变异上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们在临床实践中具有重要意义，需要采用能够平衡罕见病例重要性的方法来克服平均患者谬误。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯消息是一项极其耗时的工作，需要更高效的方法来支持检察官和调查人员从嫌疑人手机数据中获取有价值的洞察。

Method: 采用语义丰富化过程：提取消息数据并用知识图谱建模、生成语音消息转录、使用端到端实体提取方法标注数据。提供两种解决方案：基于图查询和可视化，以及基于语义搜索。

Result: 该方法已在真实调查数据中进行了实际应用，与检察官密切合作收集了积极反馈，并确定了有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据来验证信息，为研究社区提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来测试LLM在特定任务中适当接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现现有模型操作安全性普遍不足，并提出了两种基于提示的引导方法来显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署LLM时面临的核心问题是模型是否能安全地执行特定用途，而非泛化的安全问题。现有研究主要关注通用危害，而忽视了模型在特定用例中的操作安全性。

Method: 提出了操作安全性的定义，开发了OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，测试了6个模型家族的20个开源LLM，并提出了两种提示引导方法：查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都不足，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%。提示引导方法显著提升了性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM部署的紧迫问题，基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Motivation: 评估计算机使用代理在客户关系管理(CRM)工作流中的表现，特别是在Salesforce平台上的企业级任务自动化能力。

Method: 创建包含300个任务实例的SCUBA基准，基于真实用户访谈，涵盖三个主要角色，在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标。

Result: 零样本设置下，开源模型代理成功率低于5%，而闭源模型可达39%；演示增强设置下成功率可提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，通过提供真实可解释的评估来加速复杂商业软件生态系统中可靠计算机使用代理的发展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，而高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理难以适应AI工作负载的快速演进。

Method: 提出一个全生命周期管理框架，协调优化建设阶段（电力、冷却、网络配置）、硬件更新阶段（与硬件趋势对齐的更新策略）和运营阶段（软件优化）的决策。

Result: 该系统相比传统方法可将TCO降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考整个AI数据中心生命周期管理，通过跨阶段协调优化来应对工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化等挑战，为未来AI数据中心管理提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种2D感知且GPU高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速扩散变换器的高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散变换器中设计稀疏注意力时难以兼顾二维空间局部性和GPU效率，往往导致非连续内存访问问题。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token以实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时实现2.3倍注意力加速，在2048×2048时达到4.17倍加速，同时图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放性的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些类型的推理任务。

Method: 创建包含71个复合研究挑战的CritPt基准测试，这些挑战模拟入门级完整研究项目，并分解为190个更简单的检查点任务。所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究创建，采用自动化评分流程。

Result: 当前最先进的LLM在孤立检查点上表现出早期潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅为4.0%（GPT-5高），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt通过现实且标准化的评估，突显了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗等领域的应用面临两大障碍：难以准确指定奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励信号的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人强化学习中设计密集奖励通常需要大量手动工作且难以扩展，而任务进度作为密集奖励信号可以量化动作推动系统完成任务的进度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，仅需每个任务20万次环境交互，超越了先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder是一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化视频源获取丰富的奖励信号，包括利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Conclusion: 测量树为复杂构念的透明测量提供了原则性基础，支持更广泛和可解释的AI评估。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.
