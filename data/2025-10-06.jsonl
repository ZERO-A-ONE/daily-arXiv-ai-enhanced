Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that\nfoils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of\nadversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard\nadversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more\nresilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering\n(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text\ninto a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then\nquantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein\ndistance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the\nclassifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our\nPIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and\nsentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional\nadversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against\nsemantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its\nTrue Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In\nstark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the\ndiscrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.\nIt maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively\nneutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance\ndemonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than\nmerely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine\nrobustness in the adversarial arms race."}

Although no data is actively altered, such\nreconnaissance can reveal grid topology, consumption patterns, and operational\nbehavior, creating a gateway to more severe targeted attacks. Detecting this\nthreat is difficult because the signals it produces are faint, short-lived, and\noften disappear when traffic is examined by a single node or along a single\ntimeline. This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses\nphysical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and\nshort temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy\nperturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates\nspatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU\nmodels short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous\nfeatures into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for\nclassification. Training occurs in a federated learning setup under FedProx,\nimproving robustness to heterogeneous local raw data and contributing to the\ntrustworthiness of decentralized training; raw measurements remain on client\ndevices. A synthetic, standards-informed dataset is generated to emulate\nheterogeneous HAN/NAN/WAN communications with wireless-only passive\nperturbations, event co-occurrence, and leak-safe splits. The model achieves a\ntesting accuracy of 98.32% per-timestep (F1_{attack}=0.972) and 93.35%\nper-sequence at 0.15% FPR using a simple decision rule with run-length m=2 and\nthreshold $\\tau=0.55$. The results demonstrate that combining spatial and\ntemporal context enables reliable detection of stealthy reconnaissance while\nmaintaining low false-positive rates, making the approach suitable for non-IID\nfederated smart-grid deployments."}

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can\ninitiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as\nprecedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively\nlowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive\ndefense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the\ninsight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.\nWithout modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two\nmechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by\ncomparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a\ndual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''\nstored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles\nand enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show\nthat A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while\nincurring a minimal utility cost.

Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,\ncontaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those\nunseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,\nevade existing memorization-based detection methods.

Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of\ngenerated code, but there is far less on code quality.\n  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating\nthe quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which\nthe quality of LLM generated code should be improved.\n  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code\nquality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of\nprofessionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets\naccording to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to\nrepresent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation.

This metric measures the proportion of an object's\nstate, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access\nduring test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a\nhigher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software\nunder analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to\ndetermine whether tests pass or not.\n  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage\nmetric.

However, such malicious\nfine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation\nmodels. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by\nfine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased\nsensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically,\nour fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with\nbenign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can\ninitiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as\nprecedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively\nlowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive\ndefense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the\ninsight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.\nWithout modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two\nmechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by\ncomparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a\ndual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''\nstored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles\nand enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show\nthat A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while\nincurring a minimal utility cost.

A shortcut\nto achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the\ntraining data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark\ncontamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,\ncontaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those\nunseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,\nevade existing memorization-based detection methods.
