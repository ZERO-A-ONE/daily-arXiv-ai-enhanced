One of the most\ncommon tools used to check if everything is working properly is called\nStatistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking\nwhether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only\nreact after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data\nfrom a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this\ndata is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This\nmakes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model\nwas able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of\nfuture measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers\nand technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps\nreduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability\nof the production process.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{G}uided\n\\textbf{P}ivotal \\textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that\ndives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO\nfirst identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point\nthat the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem. We locate the\ncritical step by estimating the advantage function. GPO then resets the policy\nto the critical step, samples the new rollout and prioritizes the learning\nprocess on those rollouts. This focus allows the model to learn more\neffectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the\nreasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can\nbe integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning\nperformance. Besides theoretical analysis, our experiments across challenging\nreasoning benchmarks show that GPO can consistently and significantly enhance\nthe performance of existing optimization methods, showcasing its effectiveness\nand generalizability in improving LLM reasoning by concentrating on pivotal\nmoments within the generation process."}

A\nkey challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of\nthe task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a\ntask-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty\ndirectly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a\nspecific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample\nthe most informative cases for human labelling.

Runtime verification monitors\nthe runtime system behaviour by checking whether an execution trace - a\nsequence of recorded events - satisfies a given specification, yielding a\nBoolean or quantitative verdict. However, when a specification is violated,\nsuch a verdict is often insufficient to understand why the violation happened.\nTo fill this gap, diagnostics approaches aim to produce more informative\nverdicts. In this paper, we address the problem of generating informative\nverdicts for violated Inter-procedural Control-Flow Temporal Logic (iCFTL)\nspecifications that express constraints over program variable values. We\npropose a diagnostic approach based on backward data-flow analysis to\nstatically determine the relevant statements contributing to the specification\nviolation. Using this analysis, we instrument the program to produce enriched\nexecution traces. Using the enriched execution traces, we perform the runtime\nanalysis and identify the statements whose execution led to the specification\nviolation. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool, iCFTL-Diagnostics,\nand evaluated it on 112 specifications across 10 software projects. Our tool\nachieves 90% precision in identifying relevant statements for 100 of the 112\nspecifications. It reduces the number of lines that have to be inspected for\ndiagnosing a violation by at least 90%. In terms of computational cost,\niCFTL-Diagnostics generates a diagnosis within 7 min, and requires no more than\n25 MB of memory. The instrumentation required to support diagnostics incurs an\nexecution time overhead of less than 30% and a memory overhead below 20%."}

This work\nintroduces, implements, and evaluates three novel and efficient bribery\ncontracts targeting Ethereum validators. The first bribery contract enables a\nbriber to fork the blockchain by buying votes on their proposed blocks. The\nsecond contract incentivizes validators to voluntarily exit the consensus\nprotocol, thus increasing the adversary's relative staking power. The third\ncontract builds a trustless bribery market that enables the briber to auction\noff their manipulative power over the RANDAO, Ethereum's distributed randomness\nbeacon. Finally, we provide an initial game-theoretical analysis of one of the\ndescribed bribery markets."}

To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement\nlearning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial\nreasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture\ngeometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to\nmodel inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial\narrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy\noptimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and\nstructured layouts.

This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a\nnovel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse\nadversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA\ncombines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of\nclients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based\ngeometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client\nbased on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering\nof suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients,\ncountering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine\nfailures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+\nrecords) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse\nadversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves\nrobust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on\nNF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum,\nTrimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins.

Our ablation studies further\ndemonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the\nanomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%,\nrespectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach.\nThis demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated\nlearning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions."}
