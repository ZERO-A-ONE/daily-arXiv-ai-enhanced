Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations.

This paper\nintroduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to\ndetect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deployments.

We propose a hierarchical\narchitecture to prioritize lightweight models at edge gateways and deeper\nmodels at centralized nodes to balance detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. The system is validated on both simulated IoT traffic and the\nCICIDS2017 dataset, achieving over 97% detection accuracy with low false\npositive rates.

However, this migration also introduces new\nsecurity challenges. Ensuring the protection of sensitive data, maintaining\ncompliance with regulatory requirements, and mitigating the risks of cyber\nthreats are critical issues that must be addressed.

It requires deep domain\nexpertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs\namong competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving\nrequirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited\ndesign alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across\nvarious SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively\nscarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain\nknowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed\nMAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a\nknowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD\norchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and\nEvaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce\narchitectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation\nreports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative\nexperiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show\nthat MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural\ncomponents and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation\nreports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements\nspecifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally\nexplored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,\nDeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance\nin producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection\nin MAS-driven architecture design.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u84dd\u56fe\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u654f\u6377\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u3002LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "MAAD\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u5e08\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e08\uff09\u534f\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "MAAD\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eMetaGPT\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u53cd\u9988\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002GPT-4o\u5728\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "MAAD\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86LLM\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The resulting binary data is then encoded using perceptual\nillusions, such as the missing square paradox, to visually obscure the presence\nof encrypted content. Unlike conventional ciphers that rely solely on algebraic\ncomplexity, the Singularity Cipher introduces a dual-layer approach: symbolic\nencryption rooted in topology and visual steganography designed for human\ncognitive ambiguity.

However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and\nlabor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software\nengineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging\nprocess. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when\napplying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training\nLLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in\nhardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with\nexisting golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires\nmulti-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.\ncomplicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this\nwork, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the\nchallenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset\nwith 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs.

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics.

However, optimizations for\nfitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on\nhistorical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been\nexercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would\nhinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine\nhistorical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via\nan optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,\nand the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence\nindicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to\npredict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural\nnetworks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually\nimitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions\nthat have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a\nReinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition\nsequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine\nhistorical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path\ntransition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of\nfuzzing.

The approach adopts a customized multi-hop\ncharacterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.\nThrough a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and\nfive bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater\nability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to\nother baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u8f85\u52a9LLM\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u533b\u5b66LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66LLM\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u8f85\u52a9LLM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u516d\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63ed\u793aLLM\u7684\u590d\u6742\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel\nsecurity risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can\ncascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent\ntrust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability\nScoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous\nto Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In\nan ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to\ncascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust\nits outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key\nvariables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),\ncapturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.\nWe then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,\nand inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic\nAI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we\nargue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking\nframeworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.\nWe outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using\narchitectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust\nfailures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized\nagent-to-agent security evaluation.

This vulnerability could\nlead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,\nsuch as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,\nresearchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,\nmost existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While\nthese methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their\napplicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are\nmore meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper\nproposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes\na diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in\nthe black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point\ncloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D\ndiffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior\nknowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to\nclean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the\ndistribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added\nto the point cloud.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad83D\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75283D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense\nframework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's\nreliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed\ntrigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely\nmatching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on\nmodel outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate\nbenign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on\nbackdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.\nFinally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust\nperturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model\nperformance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the\nattack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three\ntypes of backdoor attacks, respectively.

Emerging machine\nlearning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer\npotential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training\ninefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning.

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an\nexample of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users\nusing a prototype-enriched model as a bridge.

At the same time, it reveals\nthat current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to\nclosed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian\nmethods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open\nphysical-world embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u672a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5f53\u4ee3\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u672a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c01\u95ed\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker.

Alternatively,\nmethods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent\nspace frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to\ntreat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules\nwithin a dual-stream framework.

Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,\nenable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and\nsupport rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper\npresents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,\ncombining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning\ncapabilities of RBNs.\n  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs\ndirectly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an\nexternal component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational\nproperties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also\npropose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic\nmodels.\n  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct\nproblems.

Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a\nsignificant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For\ninstance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only\n20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer\nthan 30% of all user preferences through active interaction.
