Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by\nintroducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of\ntransactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn\nintroduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five\ntransactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However,\nno existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four\ntransactions.\n  This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that\nis both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just\nfour transactions.

While LLMs offer potential in this regard,\ntheir true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of\nan effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance\ncapabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our\ncontributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48\ncomplex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical\nfeatures, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline\nexperiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute\neffective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration\nand transfer.

Recently, MLLM-based\nprocess judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of\nreasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important\nfor identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,\nexisting benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness\nclassification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:\nwhether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.\nTo address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence\nscores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially\nperturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and\nImage Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under\nperturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:\nConfidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and\nConfidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and\ncalibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including\nboth proprietary and open-source models.

To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software.
