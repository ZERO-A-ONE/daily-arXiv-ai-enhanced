While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions.

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86564\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u56fe\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5e93\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u9519\u8bef\u7279\u6027\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684564\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u56fe\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u572829%\u81f357%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5e93\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.

CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.\n  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.\n  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments.

However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied (dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all. In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message passing.

To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks.

Therefore, current deployments rely on trusted cloud providers to host the CVMs' underlying infrastructure. However, TEE attestations do not provide information about the operator hosting a CVM. Without knowing whether a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) runs within a provider's infrastructure, a user cannot accurately assess the risks of physical attacks. We observe a misalignment in the threat model where the workloads are protected against other tenants but do not offer end-to-end security assurances to external users without relying on cloud providers. The attestation should be extended to bind the CVM with the provider. A possible solution can rely on the Protected Platform Identifier (PPID), a unique CPU identifier. However, the implementation details of various TEE manufacturers, attestation flows, and providers vary.

As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models.

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities. This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \\numpaper{} relevant papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.

Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\u03b1> 0$ and $t\\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\\log^{2+2\u03b1}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\\log(n)\\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \\log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al.

We introduce \\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent.

These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients.

However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units.

We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.

However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. \nBy converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG).

We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability.

The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.\n  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases.

A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.

We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language \"state\" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91cd\u590d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u6027\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u603b\u7ed3\u6027\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3001\u540e\u6094\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u4ed6\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5747\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5747\u8861\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Through game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that comprehensive flexHEG agreements could remain stable under reasonable assumptions about state preferences and catastrophic risks. The report addresses critical implementation challenges including technical thresholds for AI-relevant chips, management of existing non-flexHEG hardware, and safeguards against abuse of governance power. While requiring significant international coordination, flexHEGs could provide a technical foundation for managing AI risks at the scale and speed necessary to address emerging threats to international security and stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "flexHEGs\uff08\u7075\u6d3b\u786c\u4ef6\u4fdd\u969c\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u660e\u786e\u64cd\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fd\u9645\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5931\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u519b\u4e8bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u6218\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u80fd\u529b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0cflexHEGs\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u56db\u79cd\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e24\u79cd\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u7684flexHEG\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406AI\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "flexHEGs\u867d\u9700\u56fd\u9645\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, these models often exhibit overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance.

Existing defenses mainly detect and filter malicious models, aiming to prevent a limited number of attackers from corrupting the global model. However, restoring an already compromised global model remains a challenge. A direct approach is to remove malicious clients and retrain the model using only the benign clients. Yet, retraining is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and may compromise model consistency and privacy.\n  We propose PDLRecover, a novel method to recover a poisoned global model efficiently by leveraging historical model information while preserving privacy. The main challenge lies in protecting shared historical models while enabling parameter estimation for model recovery. By exploiting the linearity of approximate Hessian matrix computation, we apply secret sharing to protect historical updates, ensuring local models are not leaked during transmission or reconstruction. PDLRecover introduces client-side preparation, periodic recovery updates, and a final exact update to ensure robustness and convergence of the recovered model. Periodic updates maintain accurate curvature information, and the final step ensures high-quality convergence. Experiments show that the recovered global model achieves performance comparable to a fully retrained model but with significantly reduced computation and time cost. Moreover, PDLRecover effectively prevents leakage of local model parameters, ensuring both accuracy and privacy in recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "PDLRecover\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u6295\u6bd2\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u53d7\u635f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3cHessian\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u62a4\u5386\u53f2\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u3002\u5305\u62ec\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7cbe\u786e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u540e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "PDLRecover\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines.
