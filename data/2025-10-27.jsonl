Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing\nefficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.\nTo address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data\nlocally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to\ncollect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated\nlearning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep\nlearning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the\ndata analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with\nminimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient\narchitectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would\nbe advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a\nmicroservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be\nstructured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable\nentities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated\nlearning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,\nand extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations\nto the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the\nprivacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an\nIoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly\navailable dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the\nproposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,\ncomprising 25 malware classes and one benign class. The results showed that our\nproposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of\ndetection and classification performance, with a 99.24%."}

In QIF there are two main perspectives\nfor the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective\nconsiders all possible runs of the system in the computation of information\nflow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run\nthe system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a\nspecific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all\nother runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and\ntrackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular\nrun based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the\nstatic perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic\nperspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper\nwe take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:\n(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the\nadversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on\nsecrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we\ndemonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic\naxioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the\ndata-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis\nstrong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and\nexplain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we\nshow that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the\nwell-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our\ndefinition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data\nreleases."}

While researchers have proposed text-based differencing\ntechniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing\nmethods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that\noperate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in\ndevelopers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or\nduplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent\nsuch block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling\ndevelopers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the\nefficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a\ntext-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of\nblock-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional\ndifferencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all\npossible line mappings and block mappings.

We observe that many open-weight RLMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,\nsuffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the\nrequests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:\nRLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after\nself-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful\nin the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them.

Drawing on\nrecent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems\nqualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated\nreliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the\nview that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's\nindependent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism\n- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic\nbases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing\nauthority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a\nmore promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to\nthis view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than\noutright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This\napproach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by\nkeeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful\nhuman oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI\nwhen reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this\naccount offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,\nparticularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability."}

A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly\nalarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,\nwithout requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial\nand vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass\nindustry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and\nMicrosoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are\nfar easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering\nthe barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core\nresearch questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors\nreliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and\n(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection\nwithout overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators\nsuch as SpeechT5.\n  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic\nevaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail\nunder both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted\nfine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding\nsignificant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after\nfine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and\nrobustness to unseen synthesis pipelines.

To address these\nchallenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to\noptimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique\nquality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as\ncrashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.\nUnfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these\nquality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as\nthese models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor\nprocessing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature\nextraction.

Co-Sight\naddresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable\nprocess through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification\n(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV\nreformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted\nfalsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among\nexpert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification\ncost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.\nTRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents\nthrough a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and\nauditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,\nsource-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout\nthe reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,\nwhere TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or\nreinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,\nCo-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last\nExam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies\nconfirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and\nconflict-aware verification drives these improvements.
