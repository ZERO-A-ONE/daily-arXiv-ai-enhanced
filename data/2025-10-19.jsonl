This paper\npresents minimal features of the operating space, yet an end-to-end simulation\nframework to analyze detect-to-mitigate latency of such intrusions in a hybrid\nterrestrial-non-terrestrial (LEO satellite) 5G system. The system model\nincludes terrestrial gNBs, satellite backhaul (with stochastic outages), and a\ndetection logic (triggered by handover instability and signal quality\nvariance). A lockdown mechanism is invoked upon detection, with optional local\nfallback to cap mitigation delays. Monte Carlo sweeps across UAV altitudes,\nspeeds, and satellite outage rates yield several insights. First, satellite\nbackhaul outages can cause arbitrarily long mitigation delays, yet, to meet\nfallback deadlines, they need to be effectively bounded. Second, while handover\ninstability was hypothesized, our results show that extra handovers have a\nnegligible effect within the range of parameters we considered. The main\nbenefit of resilience from fallback comes from the delay in limiting\nmitigation. Third, patrol UEs experience negligible collateral impact, with\nhandover rates close to terrestrial baselines. Stress scenarios further\nhighlight that fallback is indispensable in preventing extreme control-plane\nand physical security vulnerabilities: Without fallback, prolonged outages in\nthe satellite backhaul delay lockdown commands, allowing rogue UAVs to linger\ninside restricted corridors for several seconds longer.

This paper argues for an\nalternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting\ninnovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly\naccessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and\ndistilled from their largest proprietary models.\n  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety\nverification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without\nforcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates\nthat safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models\ngeneralize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider\nresearch community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible\nanalogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates\nsafety advancements.\n  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources\nlike data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public\ngood. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates\na broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper\nunderstanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have\nmore of both."}

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts\nbecome longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and\nreduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the\nprompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework\ndesigned to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large\nsets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and\nuses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,\nbased on both the query and the taxonomy structure.

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation.

To address these challenges, we introduce the\nGatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs\nagent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate\nand reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity \"latent state\" representation of the\nsystem to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All\ninteractions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a\ndeclarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the\nsystem remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality.

These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,\nlow factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and\nfidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward\nnoise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured\nreasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated\nsupervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,\nproviding execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level\nvalidation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation\nmechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.\nFinally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative\nstructure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned\nLLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,\namounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with\nauto-labeled supervision.

Finding and\nfixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more\nconcerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they\nprovide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other\nparts of the program.\n  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear\nrepeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different\nprograms, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved.

In this\nwork, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language\nmodel outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a\nsignature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given\noutput. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from\nexisting model-output association methods like language model fingerprints.
