Manual investigation of such a vast\namount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To\ncope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques\nand efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on\nsemantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and\nunsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs\ngraph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family\nattribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed\nbinaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each\nmalware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics.\nSince the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity\nchecking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique\nthat produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly\nitems and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from\nthe malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical\nvectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which\nallows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet\nemploys state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense\ncommunities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our\nextensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the\ncoverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its\nruntime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions."}

ShuffleV adopts the moving target\ndefense (MTD) philosophy, by integrating hardware units to randomly shuffle the\nexecution order of program instructions and optionally insert dummy\ninstructions, to nullify the statistical observation by attackers across\nrepetitive runs. We build ShuffleV on the open-source RISC-V core and provide\nsix design options, to suit different application scenarios. To enable rapid\nevaluation, we develop a ShuffleV simulator that can help users to (1) simulate\nthe performance overhead for each design option and (2) generate an execution\ntrace to validate the randomness of execution on their workload. We implement\nShuffleV on a Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and validate its performance with two\nrepresentative victim applications against EM SCAs, AES encryption, and neural\nnetwork inference. The experimental results demonstrate that ShuffleV can\nprovide automatic protection for these applications, without any user\nintervention or software modification."}

Standard compiler heuristics offer general applicability but\noften yield suboptimal, program-specific results due to their one-size-fits-all\nnature. While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its\nprohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches\npromise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen\nprograms. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler\nauto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization. GRACE\neffectively curtails the search space by leveraging pass synergies and a\nweighted scoring method to generate initial high-quality candidate sequences\nand a pass pool. It then employs contrastive learning, using pass\nsequence-based data augmentation, to create program embeddings that facilitate\nsimilarity-aware clustering. Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a\ncoreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to\nunseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset\nsequence and refines it using lightweight techniques. Experimental results on\nseven diverse datasets show that GRACE reduces LLVM IR instruction count by an\naverage of 10.09% on LLVM 10.0.0 and 10.19% on LLVM 18.1.6 compared to opt -Oz,\nwhile incurring an average tuning time of less than 1s per program,\ndemonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and practical effectiveness."}

To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance.

Existing studies\nfocus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider\nhow to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations\nsuch as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential\nsynergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack\n(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two\nimportant phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent\nmethod utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an\nadversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed\nstate, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final\nadversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the\ndistance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added\ninto the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.\nWe evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating\nthat (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only\nattacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its\nattacks."}

In this\nwork, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of injecting backdoors\ninto MoE-based LLMs by exploiting their inherent expert routing preferences. We\nthus propose BadSwitch, a novel backdoor framework that integrates task-coupled\ndynamic trigger optimization with a sensitivity-guided Top-S expert tracing\nmechanism. Our approach jointly optimizes trigger embeddings during pretraining\nwhile identifying S most sensitive experts, subsequently constraining the Top-K\ngating mechanism to these targeted experts.

Through comprehensive\nevaluations across three prominent MoE architectures (Switch Transformer,\nQwenMoE, and DeepSeekMoE), we demonstrate that BadSwitch can efficiently hijack\npre-trained models with up to 100% success rate (ASR) while maintaining the\nhighest clean accuracy (ACC) among all baselines.

Conventional rationalization methods typically\nimpose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired\ngeneration.

Moreover, existing\nstudies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,\nlacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit\ncooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and\nidentify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends\nto explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading\nthe system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions\nv.s collapsed rationales).

However,\nthey are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious\ninstructions hidden in a webpage deceive the agent into unwanted actions. These\nattacks can bypass traditional web security boundaries, as the AI agent\noperates with the user privileges across sites. In this paper, we present a\nnovel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an\nLLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real\ntime."}

Existing\nsolutions, from traditional AI methods to general-purpose multi-agent systems,\nfall short: they either lack deep causal reasoning or are not tailored for the\nspecialized, investigative workflows unique to SRE. To address this gap, we\npresent OpenDerisk, a specialized, open-source multi-agent framework\narchitected for SRE. OpenDerisk integrates a diagnostic-native collaboration\nmodel, a pluggable reasoning engine, a knowledge engine, and a standardized\nprotocol (MCP) to enable specialist agents to collectively solve complex,\nmulti-domain problems. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that\nOpenDerisk significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both\naccuracy and efficiency. This effectiveness is validated by its large-scale\nproduction deployment at Ant Group, where it serves over 3,000 daily users\nacross diverse scenarios, confirming its industrial-grade scalability and\npractical impact. OpenDerisk is open source and available at\nhttps://github.com/derisk-ai/OpenDerisk/"}
