Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit.

Dynamic analyses could reveal such\nbehaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is\ntypically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise\ncode with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but\nunexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze\nprogram behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible\nto reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.\n  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify\npotential bugs.

Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties\nconsistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals\nof behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended\nchanges and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.\n  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from\nnon-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program\nversions.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that\nincentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both\ncooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage\nestimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit\nassignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize\nmulti-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and\ncompetitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong\nstrategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%\nperformance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through\nself-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of\nmulti-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading\nmulti-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of\n10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL\ntraining with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for\ndeveloping generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code\nand models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS."}

Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on\npreferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning\nin RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are\ninsufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and\ninfinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses\nensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate\nheterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms.

Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods\ntypically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this\nassumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations.\nWe propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs\nbased on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of\ntext discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous\nperturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies\ncontrolled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential\nrobustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers\nare collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and\nrobust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is\napplied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness\n(WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal\nprobability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing\nprovides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by\nensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space\nperturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets\ndemonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification\nperformance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks."}

Effective and efficient scalable clone\ndetection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the\nrapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and\npotential LLM-ensemble efficacy.\n  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering\nthem down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The\ncandidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and\na commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though\nCodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates\nsuggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and\ntailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a\ntop-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\\% precision: twice the precision of\npreviously used CodeBERT.\n  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the\nselected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results\nsuggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods\nlike maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling\napproach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the\nbest-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\\% over\nindividual LLM on the commercial large-scale code."}

In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world\ntasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where\ndevelopers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to\ngenerate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt\nvariations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and\nhuman-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed\nimproves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed\nby human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin,\nindicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We\nfurther find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the\ndeveloper optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they\npropose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these\noriginal ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains."}
