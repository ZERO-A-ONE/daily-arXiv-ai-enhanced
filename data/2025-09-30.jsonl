Recently,\nthere has been a surge in GPS spoofing attacks targeting aircraft. Since GPS\nsatellite signals are weak, the spoofed high-power signal can easily overpower\nthem. These spoofed signals are often interpreted as valid by the GPS receiver,\nwhich can cause severe and cascading effects on air navigation. While much of\nthe existing research on GPS spoofing focuses on technical aspects of detection\nand mitigation, human factors are often neglected, even though pilots are an\nintegral part of aircraft operation and potentially vulnerable to deception.\nThis research addresses this gap by conducting a detailed analysis of the\nbehavior of student pilots when subjected to GPS spoofing using the Force\nDynamics 401CR flight simulator with X-Plane 11 and a Cessna 172 equipped with\nGarmin G1000. Spoofing scenarios were implemented via custom scripts that\naltered navigational data without modifying the external visual environment.\nThirty student pilots from the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona\nBeach campus with diverse flying experience levels were recruited to\nparticipate in three spoofing scenarios. A pre-simulation questionnaire was\ndistributed to measure pilot experience and confidence in GPS.Inflight\ndecision-making during the spoofing attacks was observed, including reaction\ntime to anomalies, visual attention to interface elements, and cognitive\nbiases. A post-flight evaluation of workload was obtained using a modified NASA\nTask Load Index (TLX) method. This study provides a first step toward\nidentifying human vulnerabilities to GPS spoofing amid the ongoing debate over\nGPS reliance."}

In this work, we identify previously\nunexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch\nclassification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages\nand diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method\npipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM)\nand a fine-tuned small language model. DUALLM achieves 87.4% accuracy and an\nF1-score of 0.875, significantly outperforming prior solutions. Notably, DUALLM\nsuccessfully identified 111 of 5,140 recent Linux kernel patches as addressing\nOOB or UAF vulnerabilities, with 90 true positives confirmed by manual\nverification (many do not have clear indications in patch descriptions).\nMoreover, we constructed proof-of-concepts for two identified bugs (one UAF and\none OOB), including one developed to conduct a previously unknown control-flow\nhijack as further evidence of the correctness of the classification."}

Existing defenses against spam, such as fee markets\nand staking requirements, primarily rely on economic deterrence, which fails to\ndistinguish between malicious and legitimate users and often exclude low-value\nbut honest activity. To address these shortcomings, we present StarveSpam, a\ndecentralized reputation-based protocol that mitigates spam by operating at the\ntransaction relay layer. StarveSpam combines local behavior tracking, peer\nscoring, and adaptive rate-limiting to suppress abusive actors, without\nrequiring global consensus, protocol changes, or trusted infrastructure. We\nevaluate StarveSpam using real Ethereum data from a major NFT spam event and\nshow that it outperforms existing fee-based and rule-based defenses, allowing\neach node to block over 95% of spam while dropping just 3% of honest traffic,\nand reducing the fraction of the network exposed to spam by 85% compared to\nexisting rule-based methods.

Our\napproach extracts information from CVE disclosures in the National\nVulnerability Database, augments it with external public knowledge (e.g.,\nthreat advisories, code snippets) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),\nand automates the creation of containerized environments and exploit code for\neach vulnerability. The pipeline iteratively refines generated artifacts,\nvalidates attack success with test cases, and supports complex multi-container\nsetups. Our methodology overcomes key obstacles, including noisy and incomplete\nvulnerability descriptions, by integrating LLMs and RAG to fill information\ngaps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline across different\nvulnerability types, such as memory overflows, denial of service, and remote\ncode execution, spanning diverse programming languages, libraries and years. In\ndoing so, we uncover significant inconsistencies in CVE descriptions,\nemphasizing the need for more rigorous verification in the CVE disclosure\nprocess. Our approach is model-agnostic, working across multiple LLMs, and we\nopen-source the artifacts to enable reproducibility and accelerate security\nresearch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to\nsystematically orchestrate and exploit known vulnerabilities in containerized\nenvironments by combining general-purpose LLM reasoning with CVE data and\nRAG-based context enrichment."}

Specifically,\nwe investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious\nMCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP\nserver attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy\ncomprising twelve attack categories.

The student model is then trained via a multi-task\nobjective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the\nreasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that\nsignal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the\nstudent to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a\nsuite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,\nproviding a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,\nnot just fluent mimics."}

In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena\ncan be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process\nmaps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology\nremains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This\ntopology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first\ndrives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''\nform, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp\ngrowth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by\nphase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,\nwe propose \\textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an\nSFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the\ncompetitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.\nExperiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms\nstandard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator\nfine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and\nsafety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other\nbaselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two\nwidely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as\na practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs."}

However, these methods are all\nunderpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are\nhomogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data\nis noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human\npreference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a\ndiscrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which\ncan misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of\neach label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point\nin the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by\nestablishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their\ncorresponding probabilistic models.

A Comprehensive Benchmark", "comment": null, "summary": "The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified\nmultimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.\nHowever, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does\nthis architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between\nthe constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily\nassess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for\ndetermining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance\nits generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper\ncomprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.\nRealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10\ncategories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)\nUnderstanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,\nlogic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,\nwhich necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or\ndisordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our\ndual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a\ndiagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct\nunderstanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely\ndiscern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core\nabilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations\nof 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current\nunified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that\narchitectural unification alone is insufficient.

Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment\ndetection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting\nreal-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the\ndetection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated\ntext detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the\ninteraction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial\nfor effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce\n\\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented\nwith explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM\njudges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments\nacross diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \\textit{J-Detector}\nand show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.\nFinally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated\njudgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in\nreal-world scenarios."}

In order to be able to\nrobustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by\nmodern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional\nwatermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved\nrobustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking\ntechniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing,\nand the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI\ninpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has\nundergone via image-text mismatch analysis."}

State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically\nrely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited\neffectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \\emph{SecInfer},\na novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \\emph{inference-time\nscaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more\ncompute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key\nsteps: \\emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses\nfor a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of\nsystem prompts, and \\emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the\nresponse most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments\nshow that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively\nmitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling\napproaches."}
