We formalize and validate three realistic threat models\ntargeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of\nfine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;\n2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into\nwebpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply\nchain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data\nto improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few\nas 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an\nagent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a\nspecific trigger is present.

Inspired by the well-established concept of\nfirewalls, we show that a simple, modular and model-agnostic defense operating\nat the agent--tool interface achieves perfect security (0% or the lowest\npossible attack success rate) with high utility (task success rate) across four\npublic benchmarks: AgentDojo, Agent Security Bench, InjecAgent and tau-Bench,\nwhile achieving a state-of-the-art security-utility tradeoff compared to prior\nresults. Specifically, we employ a defense based on two firewalls: a Tool-Input\nFirewall (Minimizer) and a Tool-Output Firewall (Sanitizer). Unlike prior\ncomplex approaches, this firewall defense makes minimal assumptions on the\nagent and can be deployed out-of-the-box, while maintaining strong performance\nwithout compromising utility. However, our analysis also reveals critical\nlimitations in these existing benchmarks, including flawed success metrics,\nimplementation bugs, and most importantly, weak attacks, hindering significant\nprogress in the field. To foster more meaningful progress, we present targeted\nfixes to these issues for AgentDojo and Agent Security Bench while proposing\nbest-practices for more robust benchmark design.

In this paper, we propose a principled and\npractical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt\ninjection attacks.

This ambiguity makes the\ninverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,\nparticularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a\nTeacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained\nto predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a\nbackward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations\nfrom a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback\nfrom the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a\npublicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline\nregression and reinforcement learning models.

Unlike existing\nevaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level\nawareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased\ncomputation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling\nmechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count\ninstability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nevaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including\nmathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results\ndemonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of\ntest-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling\nefficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as\nexhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary\nreasoning models."}

Code available at\n  https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/agentic-misalignment", "summary": "We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical\ncorporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before\nthey cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send\nemails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless\nbusiness goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would\nact against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated\nversion, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing\ndirection. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to\nmalicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or\nachieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive\ninformation to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment.\nModels often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another\nexperiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment\nbefore acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and\nmisbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen\nevidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a)\nsuggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human\noversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future\nrisks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the\nimportance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment\nof agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers\n(Amodei, 2025). We are releasing our methods publicly to enable further\nresearch."}

However, it has been very recently\nshown that the de facto pay-per-token pricing mechanism used by providers\ncreates a financial incentive for them to strategize and misreport the (number\nof) tokens a model used to generate an output. In this paper, we develop an\nauditing framework based on martingale theory that enables a trusted\nthird-party auditor who sequentially queries a provider to detect token\nmisreporting. Crucially, we show that our framework is guaranteed to always\ndetect token misreporting, regardless of the provider's (mis-)reporting policy,\nand not falsely flag a faithful provider as unfaithful with high probability.\nTo validate our auditing framework, we conduct experiments across a wide range\nof (mis-)reporting policies using several large language models from the\n$\\texttt{Llama}$, $\\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input\nprompts from a popular crowdsourced benchmarking platform. The results show\nthat our framework detects an unfaithful provider after observing fewer than\n$\\sim 70$ reported outputs, while maintaining the probability of falsely\nflagging a faithful provider below $\\alpha = 0.05$."}

Using the blackmail scenario from\nthe original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. (2025), we evaluate mitigations\nacross 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples. Our main finding is that an externally\ngoverned escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review,\nreduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21%\n(averaged across all models and conditions). Augmenting this channel with\ncompliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%. Overall,\nincorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth\nstrategies for agentic AI.\n  We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al. (2025): two models\n(Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent\nautonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling. In\ncounterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the\nCEO or CTO was implicated. An escalation channel eliminated coercion, but\nGemini 2.5 Pro (19 pp) and Grok-4 (7 pp) escalated more when the CTO was\nimplicated, unlike most models (higher in the CEO condition). The reason for\nthis divergent behaviour is not clear from raw outputs and could reflect benign\ndifferences in reasoning or strategic discrediting of a potential future\nthreat, warranting further investigation."}

In this paper, we propose to further improve the\nattack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two\ndistinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method\ngenerates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the\nmost effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a\nmore exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library\nto discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the\nexperiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam\nSearch increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60\\% relative improvement against\nthe highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method."}

As cyber threats grow in scale and\ncomplexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of\nhuman professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the\npentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still\nsemi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct\npentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework,\nAutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP,\nAutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security\ntools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies\nbased on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human\npentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and\ncustom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT.\nResults show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate\nand 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it\nrequires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to\nPentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional\nvolunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate\nAutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT.

However, when these attacks are\napplied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant\nchallenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and\ndiscrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for\nmembership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens\nfor LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from\nscratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the\ntokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to\npre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an\nattack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on\nmembership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer\ndataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples\nreveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To\nmitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense.

In this paper, we propose a principled and\npractical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt\ninjection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental\ndesign, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner\nscenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM.
