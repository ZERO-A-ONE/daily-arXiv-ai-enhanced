Architectural patterns and\nstrategies can provide reusable knowledge and best practices to engineer\nquantum software systems effectively and efficiently. However, quantum software\npractitioners face significant challenges in selecting and implementing\nappropriate patterns and strategies due to the complexity of quantum software\nsystems and the lack of guidelines. To address these challenges, this study\nproposes decision models for selecting patterns and strategies in six critical\ndesign areas in quantum software systems: Communication, Decomposition, Data\nProcessing, Fault Tolerance, Integration and Optimization, and Algorithm\nImplementation. These decision models are constructed based on data collected\nfrom both a mining study (i.e., GitHub and Stack Exchange) and a Systematic\nLiterature Review, which were used to identify relevant patterns and strategies\nwith their involved Quality Attributes (QAs). We then conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with 16 quantum software practitioners to evaluate the familiarity,\nunderstandability, completeness, and usefulness of the proposed decision\nmodels. The results show that the proposed decision models can aid\npractitioners in selecting suitable patterns and strategies to address the\nchallenges related to the architecture design of quantum software systems.

Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering).

To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation.

The technical or\nconfusing terminology used to describe these controls further complicates\nusers' ability to understand and use them effectively. This paper presents a\nlarge-scale empirical analysis investigating usability challenges of web\nprivacy controls across 18,628 websites. While aiming for a multi-scenario\nview, our automated data collection faced significant hurdles, particularly in\nsimulating sign-up and authenticated user visits, leading to more focused\ninsights on guest visit scenarios and challenges in automated capture of\ndynamic user interactions. Our heuristic evaluation of three different user\nvisit scenarios identifies significant website usability issues. Our results\nshow that privacy policies are most common across all visit scenarios, with\nnudges and notices being prevalent in sign-up situations.

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The\nfirst technique is a template representation transformation that sharply\nreduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient\nencoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving\nthe number of operations on encrypted templates.

To\nprovide fine-grain isolation, TDs can recursively create and manage sub-TDs.\nTyche captures these relationships in attestations, allowing cloud tenants to\nreason about end-to-end security. TDs serve as the building blocks for\nconstructing composable enclaves, sandboxes, and CVMs.\n  Tyche runs on commodity x86_64 without hardware security extensions and can\nmaintain backward compatibility with existing software. We provide an SDK to\nrun and compose unmodified workloads as sandboxes, enclaves, and CVMs with\nminimal overhead compared to native Linux execution. Tyche supports complex\ncloud scenarios, such as confidential inference with mutually distrustful\nusers, model owners, and CSPs. An additional RISC-V prototype demonstrates\nTyche's portability across platforms."}

These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the\nsigning key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed.\nWhile such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may\nbe possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle.\nOSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in\ndecentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical\ncommunication. OSS are also closely related to separations between\nclassical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and\ncommitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al.\nwas only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their\njustification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence\nof OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open.\n  We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming\n(sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also\ngives the first standard-model separation between classical and\ncollapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open\nproblem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional\nsecurity relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model\nconstruction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations\n(permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs\ninvolving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular,\nobfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is\n\\emph{full-domain}, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this\nobject from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions."}

Even though mutation\nscheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers\nhave primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation\nscheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing\nframework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and\nhybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a\nhierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid\ninitial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select\nhigh-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that\nsimultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation\nscheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an\nevolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator\nprobabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to\nescape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage\nand vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage\nand 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities\nacross diverse categories. These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness,\nadaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing\nscenarios."}

Accepted at the SOC4AI Workshop (Service-Oriented Computing\n  for AI Applications), held in conjunction with the 22nd International\n  Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC 2024)", "summary": "The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering\nflexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for\npricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and\nscale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing\n(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these\nchallenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic\nInformation Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract\nessential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from\nSaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,\nencompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's\neffectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,\nchallenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic\ncontent. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing\ntransformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for\nimproved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing\nlandscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and\nenhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites."}

To\naddress this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset\ncomprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific\nlibrary versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon\nrigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),\nLLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform\nversion-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy\nthrough execution.
