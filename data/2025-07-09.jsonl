These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code\npatterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program\nelements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,\nsuch as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models\nability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,\na high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on\nfundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning\ndata dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs\nwritten in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning\ncomplexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects\ntargets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.\nWe evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at\nidentifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative\nanalyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and\nbackward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code\nreasoning capabilities."}

Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings.

Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection.

We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing.

In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates\nlow-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a\nsingle low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one.

To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL).

The event\nlogs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about\ncustomers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be\naddressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for\nprocess discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the\nhigher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by\nanonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization\nand event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for\npartitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into\nmultiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This\npipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate\nour approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization\ntechniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery\ntechniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring\nimprovements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based\nanonymization techniques."}

Previous studies have\nisolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection\nmechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.\nOur method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate\nlayer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to\nembed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary\ninside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The\nexperimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak\nsuccess rate of 88.85\\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success\nrate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\\%.\nThis not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light\non the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for\nenhancing model security The code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN."}

We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the\nperformance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address\nthe following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI)\naddress these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose\naugmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI\ntechniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach\nacross 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and\nintroduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data\nsynthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the\nperformance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even\nin severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to\nconcept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment\nprocess. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to\ninitialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify\ncharacteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class\ndistributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using\nGenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI\ntools designed for security tasks."}
