*Sergiu Bursuc,Theodore Ehrenborg,Shaowei Lin,Lacramioara Astefanoaei,Ionel Emilian Chiosa,Jure Kukovec,Alok Singh,Oliver Butterley,Adem Bizid,Quinn Dougherty,Miranda Zhao,Max Tan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了最大的验证编码基准测试，包含12,504个形式化规范，在Dafny、Verus/Rust和Lean中测试LLM生成形式化验证代码的能力，发现Dafny表现最佳(82%)，且自然语言描述对性能提升不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立验证编码的基准测试，对比LLM从形式化规范生成验证代码（验证编码）与从自然语言描述生成可能包含错误的代码（氛围编码）的性能差异。

Method: 创建包含12,504个形式化规范的基准测试集，其中6,174个是新问题，使用现成的LLM在Dafny、Verus/Rust和Lean三个验证系统中测试验证编码成功率。

Result: 验证编码成功率：Lean 27%、Verus/Rust 44%、Dafny 82%；添加自然语言描述对性能无显著提升；过去一年Dafny纯验证性能从68%提升到96%。

Conclusion: 验证编码在Dafny中表现最佳，LLM在形式化验证方面取得显著进展，但不同验证系统间性能差异较大，自然语言描述对验证编码帮助有限。

Abstract: We present and test the largest benchmark for vericoding, LLM-generation of
formally verified code from formal specifications - in contrast to vibe coding,
which generates potentially buggy code from a natural language description. Our
benchmark contains 12,504 formal specifications, with 3,029 in Dafny, 2,334 in
Verus/Rust and 7,141 in Lean. Of these, 6,174 are new unseen problems. We find
vericoding success rates of 27% in Lean, 44% in Verus/Rust and 82% in Dafny
using off-the-shelf LLMs. Adding natural-language descriptions does not
significantly improve performance. We also find that LLM progress has improved
progress on pure Dafny verification from 68% to 96% over the past year. The
benchmark and vericoding results are shared at

*Teeradaj Racharak,Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul,Chayanee Junplong,Akara Supratak*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力解释基于机器学习的代码克隆检测器预测结果，准确率高达98%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习代码克隆检测器多为黑盒模型，缺乏决策过程解释，而传统后验解释方法需要白盒访问或计算成本高

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4解释GraphCodeBERT的代码克隆检测结果，通过调整温度参数优化解释质量

Result: 方法作为后验解释器表现良好，正确解释率达98%，良好解释率95%，但代码行示例在某些情况下才有用

Conclusion: LLM作为软件工程任务的后验解释器具有前景，降低温度参数可提高解释准确性，为未来研究提供方向

Abstract: Recent studies highlight various machine learning (ML)-based techniques for
code clone detection, which can be integrated into developer tools such as
static code analysis. With the advancements brought by ML in code
understanding, ML-based code clone detectors could accurately identify and
classify cloned pairs, especially semantic clones, but often operate as black
boxes, providing little insight into the decision-making process. Post hoc
explainers, on the other hand, aim to interpret and explain the predictions of
these ML models after they are made, offering a way to understand the
underlying mechanisms driving the model's decisions. However, current post hoc
techniques require white-box access to the ML model or are computationally
expensive, indicating a need for advanced post hoc explainers. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach that leverages the in-context learning capabilities
of large language models to elucidate the predictions made by the ML-based code
clone detectors. We perform a study using ChatGPT-4 to explain the code clone
results inferred by GraphCodeBERT. We found that our approach is promising as a
post hoc explainer by giving the correct explanations up to 98% and offering
good explanations 95% of the time. However, the explanations and the code line
examples given by the LLM are useful in some cases. We also found that lowering
the temperature to zero helps increase the accuracy of the explanation. Lastly,
we list the insights that can lead to further improvements in future work. This
study paves the way for future studies in using LLMs as a post hoc explainer
for various software engineering tasks.

### [3] [The Matthew Effect of AI Programming Assistants: A Hidden Bias in Software Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23261)
*Fei Gu,Zi Liang,Hongzong LI,Jiahao MA*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现AI辅助编程存在马太效应：编程语言或框架越流行，LLM生成代码的成功率越高，这可能强化现有生态系统的集中化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI辅助编程对软件工程迭代动态的广泛影响，特别是LLM驱动的开发如何与软件生态系统相互作用。

Method: 在数千个算法编程任务和数百个框架选择任务上进行大规模实验，系统研究AI辅助编程与软件生态系统的交互。

Result: 发现明显的马太效应：编程语言或框架越流行，LLM生成代码的成功率越高，AI系统可能强化现有流行度层级。

Conclusion: AI系统可能加速围绕主导工具的收敛，同时阻碍多样性和创新，这对编程生态系统的未来演化具有重要影响。

Abstract: AI-assisted programming is rapidly reshaping software development, with large
language models (LLMs) enabling new paradigms such as vibe coding and agentic
coding. While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation
quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics
of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct
large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and
hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how
AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis
reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming
language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The
phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity
hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering
diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this
effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming
ecosystems.

### [4] [Code Arcades: 3d Visualization of Classes, Dependencies and Software Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23297)
*Anthony Savidis,Christos Vasilopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可配置的软件可视化方法，通过灵活分组机制、多粒度软件指标和交互式可视化引擎，提升源代码理解和分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件可视化旨在通过图形化表示软件制品来增强源代码的理解、分析、维护和演化，帮助软件工程师识别结构模式、检测复杂性热点，并推断难以直接从源代码文本中感知的系统行为。

Method: 引入可配置的分组机制支持基于任意关系的代码元素灵活组织；结合细粒度和粗粒度软件指标提供系统属性的多级视角；开发交互式可视化引擎允许开发者动态调整渲染属性。

Result: 该方法提供了更适应性和洞察力的源代码理解方法，能够提供宏观概览同时支持对特定程序元素的聚焦检查。

Conclusion: 通过可配置分组、多级指标和交互式可视化引擎的组合，为大规模系统的理解提供了更灵活和深入的方法。

Abstract: Software visualization seeks to represent software artifacts graphical-ly in
two or three dimensions, with the goal of enhancing comprehension, anal-ysis,
maintenance, and evolution of the source code. In this context, visualiza-tions
employ graphical forms such as dependency structures, treemaps, or time-lines
that incorporate repository histories. These visualizations allow software
engineers to identify structural patterns, detect complexity hotspots, and
infer system behaviors that are difficult to perceive directly from source
text. By adopting metaphor-based approaches, visualization tools provide
macroscopic overviews while enabling focused inspection of specific program
elements, thus offering an accessible means of understanding large-scale
systems. The contri-bution of our work lies in three areas. First, we introduce
a configurable group-ing mechanism that supports flexible organization of code
elements based on arbitrary relationships. Second, we combine fine-grained and
coarse-grained software metrics to provide a multi-level perspective on system
properties. Third, we present an interactive visualization engine that allows
developers to dynamically adjust rendering attributes. Collectively, these
advances provide a more adaptable and insightful approach to source code
comprehension.

### [5] [Methods for evaluating software accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23469)
*Mykola Kuz,Ivan Yaremiy,Hanna Yaremii,Mykola Pikuliak,Ihor Lazarovych,Mykola Kozlenko,Denys Vekeryk*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 开发了基于分类和数学模型的软件可访问性评估方法，改进了现有标准化方法，通过分析大学网站为视障用户提供具体改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可访问性评估方法过于通用，无法满足不同用户群体的特定需求，需要开发更详细的评估指标来提升软件交互质量。

Method: 构建分类和数学模型，开发基于该模型的可访问性评估方法，作为"可用性"质量特性的子特性进行评估。

Result: 成功分析了大学网站对视障用户的包容性，提出了具体改进建议，与标准化方法相比提供了更详细和实用的评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建包容性数字环境迈出了重要一步，能够更有效地评估和改进软件的可访问性。

Abstract: The development and enhancement of methods for evaluating software
accessibility is a relevant challenge in modern software engineering, as
ensuring equal access to digital services is a key factor in improving their
efficiency and inclusivity. The increasing digitalization of society
necessitates the creation of software that complies with international
accessibility standards such as ISO/IEC 25023 and WCAG. Adhering to these
standards helps eliminate barriers to software use for individuals with diverse
physical, sensory, and cognitive needs. Despite advancements in regulatory
frameworks, existing accessibility evaluation methodologies are often
generalized and fail to account for the specific needs of different user
categories or the unique ways they interact with digital systems. This
highlights the need for the development of new, more detailed methods for
defining metrics that influence the quality of user interaction with software
products. Building a classification and mathematical model and developing
accessibility assessment methods for software based on it. A method for
assessing the quality subcharacteristic "Accessibility", which is part of the
"Usability" quality characteristic, has been developed. This enabled the
analysis of a website's inclusivity for individuals with visual impairments,
and the formulation of specific recommendations for further improvements, which
is a crucial step toward creating an inclusive digital environment. Comparing
to standardized approaches, a more detailed and practically oriented
accessibility assessment methodology has been proposed. Using this methodology,
an analysis of the accessibility of the main pages of Vasyl Stefanyk
Precarpathian National University's website was conducted, and improvements
were suggested to enhance its inclusivity.

### [6] [Improving the Efficiency of LLM Agent Systems through Trajectory Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23586)
*Yuan-An Xiao,Pengfei Gao,Chao Peng,Yingfei Xiong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出AgentDiet方法，通过识别和移除多轮LLM代理轨迹中的无用、冗余和过期信息，显著减少输入token数量（39.9%~59.7%）和计算成本（21.1%~35.9%），同时保持代理性能不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多轮代理系统在软件工程任务中越来越流行，但轨迹不断增长导致输入token计算成本高昂，效率问题在现有研究和产品中被忽视。

Method: 设计AgentDiet方法，在推理时自动识别和移除轨迹中的无用、冗余和过期信息，实现轨迹压缩。

Result: 在两个LLM和两个基准测试上的评估显示，AgentDiet能减少输入token 39.9%~59.7%，最终计算成本降低21.1%~35.9%，同时保持代理性能不变。

Conclusion: 轨迹减少是代理系统一个有前景的研究方向，能显著提升效率而不损害性能。

Abstract: Multi-turn agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have been
increasingly popular for software engineering tasks. While LLM agents show
decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the
ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications.
Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and
this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction
approach to reduce the cost of agents.
  Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless,
redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can
be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then
design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which
automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a
top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks
shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final
computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent
performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction
for agent systems.

### [7] [Similarity-Based Assessment of Computational Reproducibility in Jupyter Notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23645)
*A S M Shahadat Hossain,Colin Brown,David Koop,Tanu Malik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相似性的可重现性指数(SRI)，用于评估Jupyter Notebook中结果的可重现性。该指标使用针对不同类型Python对象的相似性度量来比较重新运行输出与原始输出，为每个生成输出的单元格提供[0,1]范围内的定量评分和定性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jupyter Notebook虽然便于运行和共享计算实验，但由于随机性、库版本变化或计算环境差异等因素，重新运行可能无法获得一致结果。需要一种量化方法来评估计算可重现性。

Method: 开发了基于相似性度量的SRI指标，使用针对不同类型Python对象的特定相似性度量方法，比较重新运行输出与原始输出。为每个输出单元格提供定量评分和定性分析。

Result: 通过案例研究展示了如何应用SRI指标来量化Jupyter Notebook的计算可重现性，证明了各种相似性度量方法在评估可重现性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SRI指标为评估Jupyter Notebook的计算可重现性提供了一种有效的量化方法，能够识别和衡量重新运行实验时结果的一致性程度。

Abstract: Computational reproducibility refers to obtaining consistent results when
rerunning an experiment. Jupyter Notebook, a web-based computational notebook
application, facilitates running, publishing, and sharing computational
experiments along with their results. However, rerunning a Jupyter Notebook may
not always generate identical results due to various factors, such as
randomness, changes in library versions, or variations in the computational
environment. This paper introduces the Similarity-based Reproducibility Index
(SRI) -- a metric for assessing the reproducibility of results in Jupyter
Notebooks. SRI employs novel methods developed based on similarity metrics
specific to different types of Python objects to compare rerun outputs against
original outputs. For every cell generating an output in a rerun notebook, SRI
reports a quantitative score in the range [0, 1] as well as some qualitative
insights to assess reproducibility. The paper also includes a case study in
which the proposed metric is applied to a set of Jupyter Notebooks,
demonstrating how various similarity metrics can be leveraged to quantify
computational reproducibility.

### [8] [PAT-Agent: Autoformalization for Model Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23675)
*Xinyue Zuo,Yifan Zhang,Hongshu Wang,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jing Sun,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PAT-Agent是一个端到端框架，结合LLM的生成能力和形式验证的严谨性，实现自然语言自动形式化和形式模型修复，帮助非专家用户构建可验证的形式模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型语言模型应用于形式验证面临挑战，包括规范语言的复杂性、输出幻觉风险以及自然语言与形式逻辑之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用规划LLM提取关键建模元素并生成详细计划，指导代码生成LLM合成语法正确且语义忠实的形式模型，通过PAT模型检查器验证，并在出现差异时触发修复循环迭代修正。

Result: 在40个系统上的实验结果显示，PAT-Agent始终优于基线方法，实现了高验证成功率和优越效率。消融研究确认了规划和修复组件的重要性。

Conclusion: PAT-Agent框架成功地将LLM与形式验证相结合，为非专家用户提供了可访问且有效的形式建模支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising potential for
automating formal methods. However, applying them to formal verification
remains challenging due to the complexity of specification languages, the risk
of hallucinated output, and the semantic gap between natural language and
formal logic. We introduce PAT-Agent, an end-to-end framework for natural
language autoformalization and formal model repair that combines the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the rigor of formal verification to automate the
construction of verifiable formal models. In PAT-Agent, a Planning LLM first
extracts key modeling elements and generates a detailed plan using semantic
prompts, which then guides a Code Generation LLM to synthesize syntactically
correct and semantically faithful formal models. The resulting code is verified
using the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker against user-specified
properties, and when discrepancies occur, a Repair Loop is triggered to
iteratively correct the model using counterexamples. To improve flexibility, we
built a web-based interface that enables users, particularly non-FM-experts, to
describe, customize, and verify system behaviors through user-LLM interactions.
Experimental results on 40 systems show that PAT-Agent consistently outperforms
baselines, achieving high verification success with superior efficiency. The
ablation studies confirm the importance of both planning and repair components,
and the user study demonstrates that our interface is accessible and supports
effective formal modeling, even for users with limited formal methods
experience.

### [9] [Satellite: Detecting and Analyzing Smart Contract Vulnerabilities caused by Subcontract Misuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23679)
*Zeqin Liao,Yuhong Nan,Zixu Gao,Henglong Liang,Sicheng Hao,Jiajing Wu,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Satellite是一个用于检测智能合约中子合约误用漏洞(SMV)的字节码级静态分析框架，通过迁移学习恢复继承方法、细粒度方法级特征比较和SMV指标识别，在真实数据集上达到84.68%的精确率和92.11%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约开发中广泛复用子合约以提高效率，但这种复用可能意外引入漏洞。由于智能合约通常编译为字节码，类级信息和语义被完全隐藏，自动检测此类问题面临独特挑战。

Method: Satellite采用迁移学习方法恢复继承方法，提取细粒度方法级特征并进行方法级比较以识别子合约复用部分，根据类型总结SMV指标集来有效识别漏洞。

Result: 在包含58个真实攻击SMV和56个SOTA研究SMV模式的数据集上，Satellite表现出良好性能，精确率84.68%，召回率92.11%。在10,011个真实智能合约中成功识别14个新的未知SMV，影响价值201,358美元的数字资产。

Conclusion: Satellite框架能够有效检测智能合约中的子合约误用漏洞，在真实环境中表现出良好的检测能力，成功识别了新的未知漏洞，证明了其在实际应用中的价值。

Abstract: Developers of smart contracts pervasively reuse subcontracts to improve
development efficiency. Like any program language, such subcontract reuse may
unexpectedly include, or introduce vulnerabilities to the end-point smart
contract. Unfortunately, automatically detecting such issues poses several
unique challenges. Particularly, in most cases, smart contracts are compiled as
bytecode, whose class-level information (e.g., inheritance, virtual function
table), and even semantics (e.g., control flow and data flow) are fully
obscured as a single smart contract after compilation.
  In this paper, we propose Satellite, a new bytecode-level static analysis
framework for subcontract misuse vulnerability (SMV) detection in smart
contracts. Satellite incorporates a series of novel designs to enhance its
overall effectiveness.. Particularly, Satellite utilizes a transfer learning
method to recover the inherited methods, which are critical for identifying
subcontract reuse in smart contracts. Further, Satellite extracts a set of
fine-grained method-level features and performs a method-level comparison, for
identifying the reuse part of subcontract in smart contracts. Finally,
Satellite summarizes a set of SMV indicators according to their types, and
hence effectively identifies SMVs. To evaluate Satellite, we construct a
dataset consisting of 58 SMVs derived from real-world attacks and collect
additional 56 SMV patterns from SOTA studies. Experiment results indicate that
Satellite exhibits good performance in identifying SMV, with a precision rate
of 84.68% and a recall rate of 92.11%. In addition, Satellite successfully
identifies 14 new/unknown SMV over 10,011 real-world smart contracts, affecting
a total amount of digital assets worth 201,358 USD.

### [10] [Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806)
*Chih-Duo Hong,Yu Wang,Yao-Chen Chang,Fang Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于影响力引导的concolic测试方法，用于Transformer分类器，通过SHAP评估路径谓词对模型输出的影响，并设计了SMT求解器兼容的注意力语义和调度启发式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统concolic测试在深度神经网络中交替执行具体执行和约束求解，但需要更有效的搜索策略来处理Transformer等现代架构。

Method: 使用SHAP-based影响力估计对路径谓词排序，设计纯Python的multi-head self-attention语义以兼容SMT求解器，并引入调度启发式控制约束增长。

Result: 在白盒研究中，影响力引导方法比FIFO基线更有效地找到标签翻转输入，在深层网络中保持稳定进展，并通过SHAP-based关键决策路径分析发现跨攻击共享的紧凑决策逻辑。

Conclusion: 影响力信号为符号探索提供了有用的搜索偏差，求解器友好的注意力语义与轻量级调度使concolic测试适用于当代Transformer模型，对调试和模型审计具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with
constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an
{influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path
predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To
enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible,
pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical
scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a
white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence
guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and
maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack
instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring,
compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that
(i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration,
and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling
make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering
potential utility for debugging and model auditing.

*Dianshu Liao,Xin Yin,Shidong Pan,Chao Ni,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: JUnitGenie是一个路径敏感的单元测试生成框架，结合代码知识和LLM的语义能力，相比现有方法显著提高了分支和行覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单元测试生成方法存在路径不敏感的问题，无法处理深度控制流结构，导致覆盖率不足。

Method: 从Java项目中提取代码知识，将其转化为结构化提示来指导LLM生成高覆盖率的单元测试。

Result: 在10个真实Java项目的2,258个复杂方法上评估，相比启发式和LLM基线方法，分支和行覆盖率分别平均提高29.60%和31.00%，并能发现真实bug。

Conclusion: JUnitGenie通过路径敏感的方法有效解决了现有测试生成技术的局限性，显著提升了测试覆盖率和质量。

Abstract: Unit testing is essential for software quality assurance, yet writing and
maintaining tests remains time-consuming and error-prone. To address this
challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit
test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent
approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs). However, these existing
approaches are inherently path-insensitive because they rely on fixed
heuristics or limited contextual information and fail to reason about deep
control-flow structures. As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate
coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we
present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining
code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware
unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects,
JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the
generation of high-coverage unit tests. We evaluate JUnitGenie on 2,258 complex
focal methods from ten real-world Java projects. The results show that
JUnitGenie generates valid tests and improves branch and line coverage by
29.60% and 31.00% on average over both heuristic and LLM-based baselines. We
further demonstrate that the generated test cases can uncover real-world bugs,
which were later confirmed and fixed by developers.

### [12] [SolContractEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Contract-Level Solidity Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23824)
*Zhifan Ye,Jiachi Chen,Zhenzhe Shao,Lingfeng Bao,Xiaohu Yang,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了SolContractEval，首个用于Solidity智能合约生成的合约级基准测试，评估了6个主流LLM在真实场景下的表现，发现Claude-3.7-Sonnet表现最佳但整体仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链发展推动智能合约需求增长，但现有LLM在Solidity语言上的有效性研究不足，且现有评估方法局限于孤立函数和合成输入，无法反映真实合约开发能力。

Method: 构建SolContractEval基准，包含124个来自真实链上合约的任务，涵盖9个主要领域，采用完整上下文依赖、结构化合约框架和简洁任务提示，并开发基于历史交易重放的动态评估框架。

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet表现最佳，但所有模型在Solidity代码生成上表现不如通用编程语言的类级生成任务；模型在标准模式任务上表现较好，但在复杂逻辑和跨合约依赖方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 当前LLM对Solidity特定功能和上下文依赖的理解有限，需要专门针对Solidity优化的模型和更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: The rise of blockchain has brought smart contracts into mainstream use,
creating a demand for smart contract generation tools. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at generating code in general-purpose languages, their
effectiveness on Solidity, the primary language for smart contracts, remains
underexplored. Solidity constitutes only a small portion of typical LLM
training data and differs from general-purpose languages in its
version-sensitive syntax and limited flexibility. These factors raise concerns
about the reliability of existing LLMs for Solidity code generation.
Critically, existing evaluations, focused on isolated functions and synthetic
inputs, fall short of assessing models' capabilities in real-world contract
development.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce SolContractEval, the first contract-level
benchmark for Solidity code generation. It comprises 124 tasks drawn from real
on-chain contracts across nine major domains. Each task input, consisting of
complete context dependencies, a structured contract framework, and a concise
task prompt, is independently annotated and cross-validated by experienced
developers. To enable precise and automated evaluation of functional
correctness, we also develop a dynamic evaluation framework based on historical
transaction replay. Building on SolContractEval, we perform a systematic
evaluation of six mainstream LLMs. We find that Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the
highest overall performance, though evaluated models underperform relative to
their capabilities on class-level generation tasks in general-purpose
programming languages. Second, current models perform better on tasks that
follow standard patterns but struggle with complex logic and inter-contract
dependencies. Finally, they exhibit limited understanding of Solidity-specific
features and contextual dependencies.

### [13] [HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835)
*Yukai Zhao,Menghan Wu,Xing Hu,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HFUZZER是一个基于短语的模糊测试框架，用于检测大型语言模型在代码生成中的包幻觉问题。它通过短语引导模型生成多样化的编码任务，能比传统方法发现更多独特的幻觉包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成中存在包幻觉风险，即推荐不存在的软件包，这可能被恶意攻击者利用进行软件供应链攻击。目前缺乏针对包幻觉的测试方法。

Method: 采用基于短语的模糊测试技术，从包信息或编码任务中提取短语，引导模型推断更广泛的信息，生成足够多样化的编码任务来测试包幻觉。

Result: HFUZZER在所有测试的LLM中都触发了包幻觉，相比变异模糊测试框架，发现了2.60倍更多的独特幻觉包，在GPT-4o测试中发现了46个独特幻觉包。

Conclusion: LLMs不仅在代码生成时存在包幻觉，在协助环境配置时也会出现此类问题。HFUZZER能有效检测包幻觉，为防御软件供应链攻击提供支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they
face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to
package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These
hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where
malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical
to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and
defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing
frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation,
there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we
propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for
package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model
to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby
generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts
phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of
phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code.
We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package
hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing
framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and
generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o,
HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that
for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation
but also when assisting with environment configuration.

*Sheikh Md Mushfiqur Rahman,Nasir Eisty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合学习型测试与假设和变异测试的方法，用于高效优先处理深度神经网络的对抗性测试用例，提升故障检测和模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在关键应用中部署时，对抗性输入的鲁棒性至关重要。现有的基于覆盖率或置信度的测试优先级方法往往无法有效识别最具故障揭示性的输入，限制了实际效果。

Method: 该方法选择具有高概率暴露模型故障的对抗性输入子集，不依赖架构特定特征或形式验证，使其能够适应各种深度神经网络。

Result: 所提出的LBT方法在优先处理故障揭示性输入和加速故障检测方面持续优于基线方法。通过高效组织测试排列，在各种数据集、模型架构和对抗攻击技术中显著更快地发现所有潜在故障。

Conclusion: 除了改进故障检测，该方法保持了输入多样性，并为模型重新训练提供了有效指导，进一步增强了鲁棒性。这些优势使其成为实际深度神经网络应用中对抗性测试优先级的有力实用解决方案。

Abstract: Context: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, where resilience against adversarial inputs is paramount.
However, whether coverage-based or confidence-based, existing test
prioritization methods often fail to efficiently identify the most
fault-revealing inputs, limiting their practical effectiveness. Aims: This
project aims to enhance fault detection and model robustness in DNNs by
integrating Learning-Based Testing (LBT) with hypothesis and mutation testing
to efficiently prioritize adversarial test cases. Methods: Our method selects a
subset of adversarial inputs with a high likelihood of exposing model faults,
without relying on architecture-specific characteristics or formal
verification, making it adaptable across diverse DNNs. Results: Our results
demonstrate that the proposed LBT method consistently surpasses baseline
approaches in prioritizing fault-revealing inputs and accelerating fault
detection. By efficiently organizing test permutations, it uncovers all
potential faults significantly faster across various datasets, model
architectures, and adversarial attack techniques. Conclusion: Beyond improving
fault detection, our method preserves input diversity and provides effective
guidance for model retraining, further enhancing robustness. These advantages
establish our approach as a powerful and practical solution for adversarial
test prioritization in real-world DNN applications.

*Jialun Zhang,Merve Gülmez,Thomas Nyman,Gang Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SandCell是一个在Rust中实现灵活轻量级隔离的系统，通过利用现有语法边界，允许程序员以最小标注工作量指定要沙箱化的组件，并提供新颖技术来最小化沙箱间数据传输的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rust通过编译时所有权和借用规则确保内存安全，但unsafe关键字允许绕过这些限制，引入重大风险。现有隔离方法仅提供固定隔离边界，无法适应需要沙箱化安全和不安全代码的表达性策略。

Method: SandCell利用Rust现有的语法边界，允许程序员以最小标注工作量指定要沙箱化的组件，实现细粒度隔离控制。系统还引入了新颖技术来最小化沙箱间数据传输的开销。

Result: 评估表明SandCell能有效防止各种Rust应用中的漏洞，同时保持合理的性能开销。

Conclusion: SandCell为Rust提供了灵活轻量级的隔离机制，能够有效防止漏洞，同时保持可接受的性能表现。

Abstract: Rust is a modern systems programming language that ensures memory safety by
enforcing ownership and borrowing rules at compile time. While the unsafe
keyword allows programmers to bypass these restrictions, it introduces
significant risks. Various approaches for isolating unsafe code to protect safe
Rust from vulnerabilities have been proposed, yet these methods provide only
fixed isolation boundaries and do not accommodate expressive policies that
require sandboxing both safe and unsafe code. This paper presents SandCell for
flexible and lightweight isolation in Rust by leveraging existing syntactic
boundaries. SandCell allows programmers to specify which components to sandbox
with minimal annotation effort, enabling fine-grained control over isolation.
The system also introduces novel techniques to minimize overhead when
transferring data between sandboxes. Our evaluation demonstrates SandCell's
effectiveness in preventing vulnerabilities across various Rust applications
while maintaining reasonable performance overheads.

### [16] [PerfBench: Can Agents Resolve Real-World Performance Bugs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24091)
*Spandan Garg,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了PerfBench基准测试，包含81个真实世界的性能bug修复任务，用于评估软件工程代理在性能优化方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，缺乏对性能bug等非功能性问题的评估，而性能bug难以检测和修复。

Method: 从GitHub热门.NET仓库收集真实性能bug修复任务，开发了新型评估框架让代理生成性能基准测试，通过比较执行指标来验证修复。

Result: 当前最先进的编码代理在性能优化任务上表现不佳，OpenHands代理只有约3%成功率。开发的OpenHands-Perf-Agent通过性能感知工具和指令达到约20%成功率。

Conclusion: 通过提供适当的基准测试指令和工具可以显著提升代理性能，但仍有改进空间。PerfBench为推进代理修复性能问题的能力提供了挑战性测试集。

Abstract: Performance bugs are inefficiencies in software that waste computational
resources without causing functional failures, making them particularly
challenging to detect and fix. While recent advances in Software Engineering
agents have shown promise in automated bug fixing, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on functional correctness and fail to evaluate agents'
abilities to identify and resolve non-functional issues like performance bugs.
We introduce PerfBench, a benchmark comprising 81 real-world performance
bug-fixing tasks from popular .NET repositories on GitHub. Unlike existing
benchmarks that rely on pre-existing test suites, PerfBench features a novel
evaluation harness that allows agents to generate their own performance
benchmarks and validates fixes by comparing execution metrics collected for
developer fix and agent fix. Each task in PerfBench is derived from actual
developer fixes linked to performance-related issues, which are then verified
by human experts, ensuring real-world relevance. Our evaluation reveals that
current state-of-the-art coding agents struggle with performance optimization
tasks, with baseline OpenHands agent achieving only a ~3% success rate on our
benchmark. We develop OpenHands-Perf-Agent, which incorporates
performance-aware tooling and instructions and achieves a ~20% success rate on
the benchmark. We show that by ensuring the agent has proper instructions to
benchmark its changes and tooling for benchmark output processing, we can
improve the agent performance significantly, but room for improvement still
remains. PerfBench provides a challenging test set for furthering the
capabilities of agents in fixing performance issues.

### [17] [TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148)
*Yiran Hu,Nan Jiang,Shanchao Liang,Yi Wu,Lin Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TENET是一个在TDD设置下生成复杂仓库中函数的LLM智能体，通过测试套件选择、代码检索和基于反馈的迭代优化，显著提升了代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在vibe coding时代，开发者越来越多地使用LLM生成代码，但自然语言描述和代码上下文不足以明确定义功能，TDD的测试用例作为可执行规范变得尤为重要。然而，在TDD下的vibe coding面临测试套件选择、上下文检索和测试反馈利用三大挑战。

Method: TENET包含三个核心组件：(1) 新颖的测试框架机制，选择简洁测试套件以最大化目标使用场景的多样性；(2) 定制的智能体工具集，实现高效代码检索和交互式调试；(3) 基于反思的优化工作流，迭代分析失败、补充上下文并应用代码优化。

Result: 在RepoCod和RepoEval基准测试上，TENET分别达到69.08%和81.77%的Pass@1，比最佳基线智能体分别高出9.49和2.17个百分点。

Conclusion: 这是首个在仓库级别上下文中研究测试驱动代码生成的工作，探讨了测试套件的不同方面如何影响TDD设置下LLM智能体的性能。

Abstract: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering
practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code
implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and
refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code
writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions,
TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications
that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what
natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding
under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small
yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the
execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively,
and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To
address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating
functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET
features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a
concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a
tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with
interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that
iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code
refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval
benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17
percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of
test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how
different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the
TDD setting.

### [18] [Metamorphic Testing for Audio Content Moderation Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24215)
*Wenxuan Wang,Yongjiang Wu,Junyuan Zhang,Shuqing Li,Yun Peng,Wenting Chen,Shuai Wang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了MTAM——一种用于音频内容审核软件的蜕变测试框架，通过定义14种蜕变关系生成能够逃避检测的有害音频测试用例，在测试5个商业审核软件和1个学术模型时发现了显著的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频平台被滥用于传播有害内容，现有审核工具容易被恶意行为者通过轻微修改音频内容（如改变音调、插入噪声）绕过，且现代音频审核工具对此类对抗性输入的防御效果研究不足。

Method: 提出MTAM蜕变测试框架，在2000个音频片段上进行试点研究，定义14种蜕变关系（分为基于音频特征和启发式扰动两类），应用这些关系生成有害但更可能逃避检测的测试用例。

Result: 测试5个商业内容审核软件和1个学术模型，MTAM在Gladia、Assembly AI、Baidu、Nextdata和Tencent上分别达到38.6%、18.3%、35.1%、16.7%和51.1%的错误发现率，在学术算法上达到45.7%的错误发现率。

Conclusion: MTAM框架有效揭示了现有音频内容审核软件的脆弱性，能够生成成功逃避检测的有害音频内容，表明当前审核系统在面对精心设计的对抗性攻击时存在明显缺陷。

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp
and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content
in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to
disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive
advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative
consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,
researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio
content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious
actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio
content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the
effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs
remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a
Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.
Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14
metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based
and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic
audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more
likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five
commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against
three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,
18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing
commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,
Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when
testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了开源和商业大语言模型在财务报告分析和评论生成中的应用，重点关注软件工程实施挑战，通过设计科学研究方法开发了两个系统并评估其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在复杂自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但在金融等特定领域的应用研究仍然有限，需要探索其在财务报告自动化中的实际应用潜力。

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，通过探索性案例研究迭代设计和评估了两个基于LLM的系统：一个使用本地开源模型的多智能体工作流，另一个使用商业GPT-4o模型，并通过专家评估进行验证。

Result: LLM在财务报告自动化任务中展现出强大潜力，但集成面临显著挑战。云模型提供更优的流畅性和可用性但存在数据隐私问题，本地开源模型提供更好的数据控制但需要更多工程努力。

Conclusion: LLM在财务报告自动化中具有强大潜力，但成功集成需要仔细关注架构设计、提示工程和系统可靠性，通过定制验证机制和工程策略平衡准确性、控制和合规性。

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable automation of complex natural
language processing across domains, but research on domain-specific
applications like Finance remains limited. Objectives: This study explored
open-source and commercial LLMs for financial report analysis and commentary
generation, focusing on software engineering challenges in implementation.
Methods: Using Design Science Research methodology, an exploratory case study
iteratively designed and evaluated two LLM-based systems: one with local
open-source models in a multi-agent workflow, another using commercial GPT-4o.
Both were assessed through expert evaluation of real-world financial reporting
use cases. Results: LLMs demonstrated strong potential for automating financial
reporting tasks, but integration presented significant challenges. Iterative
development revealed issues including prompt design, contextual dependency, and
implementation trade-offs. Cloud-based models offered superior fluency and
usability but raised data privacy and external dependency concerns. Local
open-source models provided better data control and compliance but required
substantially more engineering effort for reliability and usability.
Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for financial reporting automation, but
successful integration requires careful attention to architecture, prompt
design, and system reliability. Implementation success depends on addressing
domain-specific challenges through tailored validation mechanisms and
engineering strategies that balance accuracy, control, and compliance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于3值DFA的DFA分解识别新方法，显著提升传统Pareto最优DIP的效率，并为状态最优DIP提供可扩展解决方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DFA学习方法产生庞大且缺乏简单性和互操作性的单一DFA，现有DFA分解方法依赖APTA存在可扩展性限制

Method: 使用3值DFA替代APTA，直接从标记示例推导紧凑表示，改进SAT编码减少变量数量

Result: 实验结果显示3DFA方法在Pareto最优DIP上实现显著效率提升，并为状态最优DIP提供可扩展解决方案

Conclusion: 3DFA框架有效解决DFA分解识别问题，消除APTA冗余，大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: The identification of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) from labeled
examples is a cornerstone of automata learning, yet traditional methods focus
on learning monolithic DFAs, which often yield a large DFA lacking simplicity
and interoperability. Recent work addresses these limitations by exploring DFA
decomposition identification problems (DFA-DIPs), which model system behavior
as intersections of multiple DFAs, offering modularity for complex tasks.
However, existing DFA-DIP approaches depend on SAT encodings derived from
Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptors (APTAs), incurring scalability limitations due
to their inherent redundancy.
  In this work, we advance DFA-DIP research through studying two variants: the
traditional Pareto-optimal DIP and the novel states-optimal DIP, which
prioritizes a minimal number of states. We propose a novel framework that
bridges DFA decomposition with recent advancements in automata representation.
One of our key innovations replaces APTA with 3-valued DFA (3DFA) derived
directly from labeled examples. This compact representation eliminates
redundancies of APTA, thus drastically reducing variables in the improved SAT
encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3DFA-based approach
achieves significant efficiency gains for the Pareto-optimal DIP while enabling
a scalable solution for the states-optimal DIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的日志异常检测方法缺乏可解释性，服务提供商无法理解检测机制，阻碍了在实际生产环境中的部署和信任。

Method: 提出FaithLog系统，采用因果引导注意力机制和对抗一致性学习来确保诊断忠实性，设计了基于注意力的根因定位和事件扰动两个评估任务。

Result: 在两个公共数据集和一个工业数据集上的评估表明，FaithLog在诊断忠实性方面达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaithLog通过确保诊断忠实性，为日志异常检测系统提供了可信的解释能力，有助于在实际生产环境中获得服务提供商的信任和部署。

Abstract: Log-based software reliability maintenance systems are crucial for sustaining
stable customer experience. However, existing deep learning-based methods
represent a black box for service providers, making it impossible for providers
to understand how these methods detect anomalies, thereby hindering trust and
deployment in real production environments. To address this issue, this paper
defines a trustworthiness metric, diagnostic faithfulness, for models to gain
service providers' trust, based on surveys of SREs at a major cloud provider.
We design two evaluation tasks: attention-based root cause localization and
event perturbation. Empirical studies demonstrate that existing methods perform
poorly in diagnostic faithfulness. Consequently, we propose FaithLog, a
faithful log-based anomaly detection system, which achieves faithfulness
through a carefully designed causality-guided attention mechanism and
adversarial consistency learning. Evaluation results on two public datasets and
one industrial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chimera的端到端日志故障诊断方法，通过异常检测和根因定位之间的双向交互和知识转移，解决了现有方法中诊断偏差积累、依赖昂贵监控数据和忽视任务协作关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障诊断方法采用任务独立的方式，无法在数据形式和诊断目标上弥合异常检测与根因定位之间的差距，导致诊断偏差积累、系统部署依赖昂贵监控数据以及忽视诊断任务间协作关系三大问题。

Method: 基于交互式多任务学习，在数据、特征和诊断结果三个层面精心设计异常检测与根因定位之间的交互策略，在统一的端到端框架内实现两个子任务的交互式执行。

Result: 在两个公共数据集和一个工业数据集上的评估显示，Chimera在异常检测和根因定位方面均优于现有方法，分别实现了2.92%-5.00%和19.01%-37.09%的性能提升，并已成功部署在工业云平台中。

Conclusion: Chimera通过双向交互和知识转移实现了端到端的故障诊断，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在实际工业环境中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Log-based fault diagnosis is essential for maintaining software system
availability. However, existing fault diagnosis methods are built using a
task-independent manner, which fails to bridge the gap between anomaly
detection and root cause localization in terms of data form and diagnostic
objectives, resulting in three major issues: 1) Diagnostic bias accumulates in
the system; 2) System deployment relies on expensive monitoring data; 3) The
collaborative relationship between diagnostic tasks is overlooked. Facing this
problems, we propose a novel end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis method,
Chimera, whose key idea is to achieve end-to-end fault diagnosis through
bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer between anomaly detection and
root cause localization. Chimera is based on interactive multi-task learning,
carefully designing interaction strategies between anomaly detection and root
cause localization at the data, feature, and diagnostic result levels, thereby
achieving both sub-tasks interactively within a unified end-to-end framework.
Evaluation on two public datasets and one industrial dataset shows that Chimera
outperforms existing methods in both anomaly detection and root cause
localization, achieving improvements of over 2.92% - 5.00% and 19.01% - 37.09%,
respectively. It has been successfully deployed in production, serving an
industrial cloud platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的智能代理正在推动服务计算从静态的请求-响应功能向动态、目标导向和自主的多代理生态系统转变，需要新的计算范式来应对这一变革。

Method: 提出了ASC生命周期框架，围绕四个核心阶段：设计、部署、运营和演进；通过四个研究维度系统分析：感知与环境建模、自主决策与任务执行、多代理协作与组织、评估与可信度。

Result: 研究发现代理服务不是简单组装而是精心编排的：上下文感知支持稳健部署，自主推理支持实时运营，协作结构通过交互涌现和演进，可信度是贯穿始终的终身要求。

Conclusion: 通过整合传统服务计算原则与基于LLM的多代理系统进展，为ASC建立了全面前瞻的基础，为开发自适应、可问责和以人为本的智能服务提供了统一参考。

Abstract: The rise of LLM-powered agents is driving a fundamental transformation in
services computing: from static, request-response functions to dynamic,
goal-oriented, and autonomous multi-agent ecosystems. In response to this
shift, we introduce Agentic Service Computing (ASC), a new paradigm that
reimagines services as intelligent, self-adaptive, and socially embedded
entities. This comprehensive survey presents a lifecycle-driven framework for
ASC, structured around four core phases: Design, Deployment, Operation, and
Evolution. We systematically analyze ASC through four foundational research
dimensions: (1) Perception, Context, and Environment Modeling, (2) Autonomous
Decision-Making and Task Execution, (3) Multi-Agent Collaboration and
Organization, and (4) Evaluation, Value Alignment, and Trustworthiness. We
examine how these dimensions are instantiated, integrated, and continuously
adapted across the service lifecycle. Our synthesis reveals that agentic
services are not merely assembled but orchestrated: contextual awareness
enables robust deployment; autonomous reasoning supports real-time operation;
collaborative structures emerge and evolve through interaction; and
trustworthiness must be upheld as a cross-cutting, lifelong imperative. We
further identify and discuss emerging trends shaping the future of ASC. By
integrating classical principles of services computing with advances in
LLM-based multi-agent systems, this work establishes a holistic and
forward-looking foundation for ASC. It provides a unified reference for
researchers and practitioners aiming to develop adaptive, accountable, and
human-centered intelligent services.

TL;DR: TESTUPDATER是一个基于LLM的自动化单元测试更新方法，能够即时响应生产代码变化，既能修复损坏的测试，也能增强现有测试以验证新功能，通过上下文提取、逐步引导和迭代优化机制显著提高测试更新的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手动维护单元测试效率低下且容易遗漏修复，现有自动化方法主要关注测试修复而忽视测试增强，且依赖基于规则的上下文收集，缺乏验证机制，难以处理复杂代码变更且生成测试用例正确率低。

Method: 1) 利用LLM分析代码变更并识别相关上下文；2) 通过精心设计的提示逐步引导LLM处理各类代码变更和引入新依赖；3) 引入基于错误类型的迭代优化机制，执行LLM更新的测试并修复失败。

Result: 在新建基准UPDATES4J上，TESTUPDATER实现了94.4%的编译通过率和86.7%的测试通过率，分别比最先进方法SYNTER高出15.9%和20.0%，分支覆盖率和行覆盖率分别比SYNTER高12.9%和15.2%。

Conclusion: TESTUPDATER通过LLM驱动的上下文分析、逐步引导和迭代优化，有效解决了自动化测试维护中的测试修复和增强问题，显著提高了测试更新的正确性和覆盖率。

Abstract: Unit testing is critical for ensuring software quality and software system
stability. The current practice of manually maintaining unit tests suffers from
low efficiency and the risk of delayed or overlooked fixes. Therefore, an
automated approach is required to instantly update unit tests, with the
capability to both repair and enhance unit tests. However, existing automated
test maintenance methods primarily focus on repairing broken tests, neglecting
the scenario of enhancing existing tests to verify new functionality.
Meanwhile, due to their reliance on rule-based context collection and the lack
of verification mechanisms, existing approaches struggle to handle complex code
changes and often produce test cases with low correctness. To address these
challenges, we propose TESTUPDATER, a novel LLM based approach that enables
automated just-in-time test updates in response to production code changes.
TESTUPDATER first leverages the LLM to analyze code changes and identify
relevant context, which it then extracts and filters. Then, through carefully
designed prompts, TESTUPDATER guides the LLM step by step to handle various
types of code changes and introduce new dependencies, enabling both test repair
and enhancement. Finally, we introduce an error-type-aware iterative refinement
mechanism that executes the LLM-updated tests and repairs failures, which
significantly improves the overall correctness of test updates. Since existing
test repair datasets lack scenarios of test enhancement, we further construct a
new benchmark, UPDATES4J, with 195 real-world samples from 7 projects.
Experimental results show that TESTUPDATER achieves a compilation pass rate of
94.4% and a test pass rate of 86.7%, outperforming the state-of-the-art method
SYNTER by 15.9% and 20.0%, respectively. Furthermore, TESTUPDATER exhibits
12.9% higher branch coverage and 15.2% greater line coverage than SYNTER.

code size inflation. This paper introduces JSProtect, a high-throughput
parallelized obfuscation framework designed to overcome these fundamental
limitations. At the core of our framework is the Parallel-Aware Scope Analysis
(PASA) algorithm, which enables two key optimizations: independent code
partitioning for multi-core processing and independent namespace management
that aggressively reuses short identifiers to combat code bloat. Our evaluation
demonstrates that JSProtectprocesses 20MB codebases in minutes, maintaining
100\% semantic equivalence while controlling code size inflation to as low as
20\% compared to over 1,000\% with baseline tools. Furthermore, it preserves
near-native runtime performance and provides superior security effectiveness
against both static analysis tools and large language models. This work
presents a new paradigm for industrial-scale JavaScript protection that
effectively balances robust security with high performance and scalability.

### [27] [SemGuard: Real-Time Semantic Evaluator for Correcting LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24507)
*Qinglin Wang,Zhihong Sun,Ruyun Wang,Tao Huang,Zhi Jin,Ge Li,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SemGuard是一个语义评估器驱动的框架，通过实时行级语义监督来减少LLM生成代码时的语义错误，无需执行程序或测试用例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的代码中语义错误占多数，后修复方法存在延迟、依赖不完整测试套件和错误定位不准的问题，需要在解码过程中早期注入语义信号。

Method: 构建SemDiff数据集标记正确和错误实现的分歧点，训练语义评估器嵌入LLM解码器，实时检测部分代码偏差并回滚到错误行进行重新生成。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SemGuard始终优于最先进基线方法，在SemDiff上相比ROCODE降低语义错误率19.86%，在LiveCodeBench上提升Pass@1 48.92%。

Conclusion: SemGuard展示了模型和语言无关的有效性，能够显著减少LLM生成代码时的语义错误，提高代码生成质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate natural language requirements into
code, yet empirical analyses of representative models reveal that semantic
errors-programs that compile but behave incorrectly-constitute the majority of
observed faults (e.g., >60% on DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B and QwenCoder-7B). Post-hoc
repair pipelines detect such faults only after execution, incurring latency,
relying on incomplete test suites, and often mis-localizing the defect. Since
semantic drift originates in the autoregressive decoding process, intervening
while the code is being generated is a direct way to stop error propagation.
Constrained-decoding approaches such as ROCODE attempt this, but still wait
until the entire program runs to obtain feedback and use entropy heuristics
that do not truly capture semantics. A more effective solution must inject
semantic signals-early and precisely-into the decoding process.We present
SemGuard, a semantic-evaluator-driven framework that performs real-time,
line-level semantic supervision. To train the evaluator, we build SemDiff, the
first dataset with fine-grained annotations that mark the exact line where a
correct and an incorrect implementation diverge. The evaluator, once embedded
in the LLM's decoder, flags deviations on partial code, rolls back to the
faulty line, and guides regeneration-without executing the program or requiring
test cases. Across four benchmarks, SemGuard consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. It lowers the semantic error rate by 19.86% on
SemDiff relative to ROCODE, and lifts Pass@1 by 48.92% on the real-world
LiveCodeBench with CodeLlama-7B. Similar gains hold for StarCoder2-7B on MBPP
and for DeepSeekCoder-6.7B on the Java benchmark SemDiff-Java, demonstrating
model- and language-agnostic effectiveness.

*Yu-Fu Fu,Meng Xu,Taesoo Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MSG是一个为Move智能合约设计的自动化规范生成工具，展示了LLM在非主流编程语言中的强大代码理解和生成能力，通过模块化设计和验证工具链反馈显著提升了规范质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规范生成工具主要关注主流编程语言，而新兴的验证导向语言如Move尚未得到充分探索，需要专门工具来填补这一空白。

Method: 采用基于LLM的模块化设计，显式利用规范语言特性，并整合验证工具链的反馈机制。

Result: MSG成功为84%的Move函数生成可验证规范，识别出专家遗漏的条款，比传统设计多生成57%的可验证条款，通过验证反馈使可验证规范数量增加30%。

Conclusion: LLM在非主流语言中同样具备强大的规范生成能力，模块化设计和验证工具链集成能显著提升规范生成效果，为新兴编程语言生态提供有效支持。

Abstract: While LLM-based specification generation is gaining traction, existing tools
primarily focus on mainstream programming languages like C, Java, and even
Solidity, leaving emerging and yet verification-oriented languages like Move
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MSG, an automated specification
generation tool designed for Move smart contracts. MSG aims to highlight key
insights that uniquely present when applying LLM-based specification generation
to a new ecosystem. Specifically, MSG demonstrates that LLMs exhibit robust
code comprehension and generation capabilities even for non-mainstream
languages. MSG successfully generates verifiable specifications for 84% of
tested Move functions and even identifies clauses previously overlooked by
experts. Additionally, MSG shows that explicitly leveraging specification
language features through an agentic, modular design improves specification
quality substantially (generating 57% more verifiable clauses than conventional
designs). Incorporating feedback from the verification toolchain further
enhances the effectiveness of MSG, leading to a 30% increase in generated
verifiable specifications.

### [29] [Bridging Developer Instructions and Code Completion Through Instruction-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24637)
*Zhensu Sun,Chengran Yang,Chao Peng,Pengfei Gao,Xiaoning Du,Li Li,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了IFIM方法，通过指令微调增强代码补全模型，在保持原有填充能力的同时显著提升指令跟随性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM在代码补全中难以有效利用开发者提供的自然语言指令，而传统指令微调会损害填充中间任务性能

Method: IFIM方法在传统FIM训练目标基础上加入显式指令部分，使用(前缀,指令,后缀)三元组进行训练，构建了大规模数据集

Result: 在HumanEval-infilling基准上，Pass@1得分从84.6%提升至93.6%，且不影响无指令时的原始FIM性能

Conclusion: IFIM成功解决了指令跟随与填充能力之间的权衡问题，为代码补全系统提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code completion, yet
they often fail when the developer's intent is underspecified in the code
context. To address this, developers usually add natural language instructions
(e.g., comments) into the code context to clarify their intent. However,
existing code LLMs applied for code completion systems merely undergo a
fill-in-the-middle (FIM) pre-training, which struggles to leverage this
information effectively due to the lack of instruction-like training data.
Existing instruction-tuning techniques, which improve instruction-following in
general code generation, paradoxically degrade FIM performance, forcing a
trade-off between instruction-following and infilling capabilities. To address
this gap, we introduce Instruction-aware Fill-in-the-Middle (IFIM), an
instruction-tuning method specifically designed to enhance FIM code completion
models. IFIM extends the conventional FIM training objective by incorporating
an explicit instruction section into the input, enabling the model to learn
from (prefix, instruction, suffix) triplets. This approach allows the model to
effectively leverage developer-provided directives while preserving its core
completion abilities when no instructions are present. To facilitate this, we
constructed a large-scale dataset by using GPT-4o to generate concise,
intent-focused instructions for code infilling examples. We evaluated IFIM by
applying it to two popular base models, Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder, on
the benchmarks derived from HumanEval-infilling and RepoMasterEval. The results
demonstrate that IFIM significantly improves instruction-following
capabilities, boosting the Pass@1 score from 84.6% to 93.6% on
HumanEval-infilling. Moreover, this enhancement does not compromise the models'
original performance on FIM code completion tasks with no instructions
provided.

### [30] [CoTune: Co-evolutionary Configuration Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24694)
*Gangda Xiong,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoTune是一个通过协同进化方法自动调优系统配置的工具，能够有效处理复杂的性能需求，避免传统调优器忽视需求信息或简单将其作为目标的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调优器设计大多忽略了复杂性能需求的存在，只是假设更好的性能总是更受青睐。这不仅浪费了需求中的宝贵信息，还可能消耗大量资源来调优一个收益很小的目标。

Method: CoTune通过协同进化方法，创建一个辅助性能需求与配置共同进化，当目标性能需求变得无效或误导时提供帮助，使调优能够在需求指导下进行同时对其危害保持鲁棒性。

Result: 在162个案例（9个系统和18个需求）上的实验结果显示，CoTune显著优于现有调优器，在90%的情况下排名最佳（其他调优器为0%-35%），整体改进高达2.9倍，且效率更高。

Conclusion: CoTune通过协同进化方法成功解决了性能需求在系统配置调优中的有效利用问题，在保持高效率的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: To automatically tune configurations for the best possible system performance
(e.g., runtime or throughput), much work has been focused on designing
intelligent heuristics in a tuner. However, existing tuner designs have mostly
ignored the presence of complex performance requirements (e.g., the latency
shall ideally be 2 seconds), but simply assume that better performance is
always more preferred. This would not only waste valuable information in a
requirement but might also consume extensive resources to tune for a goal with
little gain. Yet, prior studies have shown that simply incorporating the
requirement as a tuning objective is problematic since the requirement might be
too strict, harming convergence; or its highly diverse satisfactions might lead
to premature convergence. In this paper, we propose CoTune, a tool that takes
the information of a given target performance requirement into account through
co-evolution. CoTune is unique in the sense that it creates an auxiliary
performance requirement to be co-evolved with the configurations, which assists
the target performance requirement when it becomes ineffective or even
misleading, hence allowing the tuning to be guided by the requirement while
being robust to its harm. Experiment results on 162 cases (nine systems and 18
requirements) reveal that CoTune considerably outperforms existing tuners,
ranking as the best for 90% cases (against the 0%--35% for other tuners) with
up to 2.9x overall improvements, while doing so under a much better efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型已被广泛用于行为建模，但缺乏对该领域研究的系统性综述。这样的综述有助于确定未来研究方向，并为从业者和教育者提供关于LLMs在行为建模中有效性的参考。

Method: 通过术语搜索筛选并确定了14篇相关的主要研究，对这些研究进行了系统分析，重点关注LLMs在用例图和序列图生成方面的应用。

Result: 分析显示LLMs在自动生成用例图和序列图方面取得了有希望的结果，但当前文献大多缺乏专家评估，且主要使用基于GPT的模型。

Conclusion: 未来研究应评估更广泛的大语言模型用于行为建模，并让领域专家参与评估LLMs的输出质量。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been extensively utilized
for behavioral modeling, for example, to automatically generate sequence
diagrams. However, no overview of this work has been published yet. Such an
overview will help identify future research directions and inform practitioners
and educators about the effectiveness of LLMs in assisting behavioral modeling.
This study aims to provide an overview of the existing research on the use of
LLMs for behavioral modeling, particularly focusing on use case and sequence
diagrams. Through a term-based search, we filtered and identified 14 relevant
primary studies. Our analysis of the selected primary studies reveals that LLMs
have demonstrated promising results in automatically generating use case and
sequence diagrams. In addition, we found that most of the current literature
lacks expert-based evaluations and has mainly used GPT-based models. Therefore,
future work should evaluate a broader range of LLMs for behavioral modeling and
involve domain experts to evaluate the output of LLMs.

*Lekang Yang,Yuetong Liu,Yitong Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DiffTester是一个针对扩散语言模型在单元测试生成中的加速框架，通过识别测试代码中的重复结构模式，在不降低质量的前提下提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在单元测试生成中逐个token生成效率低下，扩散LLM虽有并行生成潜力，但面临效率与测试质量之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过抽象语法树分析动态识别单元测试中的重复结构模式，自适应增加每步生成的token数量，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在三个基准测试和两种代表性模型上的实验表明，DiffTester在保持测试覆盖率的同时实现了显著加速，且在不同dLLM和编程语言上具有良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: DiffTester为软件开发中的高效单元测试生成提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes
the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.
However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each
forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)
have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing
strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application
to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test
quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often
causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this
limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically
tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests
targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By
dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree
analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of
tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To
enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,
which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages
including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two
representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration
while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across
different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable
solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用静态分析反馈的框架，帮助基础模型检测和修复其生成的DSL工作流中的缺陷，从而提高工作流生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型生成DSL工作流时存在高缺陷率（87.27%），需要自动化方法来检测和修复这些缺陷，以实现从自然语言需求可靠生成可执行工作流。

Method: 开发了Timon静态分析器来识别工作流中的缺陷，并构建Pumbaa工具结合Timon反馈来修复缺陷。

Result: 识别了18种缺陷类型，其中9种可通过静态分析检测，通过反馈机制成功修复了检测到的缺陷。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现从自然语言需求可靠自动化生成可执行工作流提供了关键步骤，显著提高了工作流生成的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in comprehending complex natural language to perform intricate tasks.
Successfully executing these tasks often requires orchestrating calls to FMs
alongside other software components. However, manually decomposing a task into
a coherent sequence of smaller, logically aggregated steps, commonly referred
to as workflows, demands considerable effort and specialized domain knowledge.
While FMs can assist in generating such workflows specified in domain-specific
languages (DSLs), achieving accuracy and reliability in this process remains a
challenge.
  This work introduces a framework that leverages static analysis feedback to
enable FMs to detect and repair defects in the DSL-based workflows they
generate. We begin by presenting the first-ever taxonomy of incidences of
defects in FM-generated DSL workflows, categorizing them into 18 distinct
types. Furthermore, we observe a high prevalence of defects across FM-generated
DSL workflows, with 87.27% of the studied instances containing at least one
defect. This, in turn, emphasizes the magnitude of the problem in practice and
underscores the necessity for implementing mitigation strategies. Following
this, we demonstrate that nine types of these defects can be effectively
identified through static analysis of the workflows. For this purpose, we
develop Timon, the first-of-its-kind static analyzer specifically designed for
FM-generated DSL workflows. Finally, we show that by incorporating feedback
from Timon, we can guide Pumbaa, an FM-based tool, to repair the detected
defect incidences. By systematically detecting and repairing defects, our work
provides a crucial step towards the reliable and automated generation of
executable workflows from natural language requirements.

TL;DR: 该研究通过飞行模拟器实验，分析了学生飞行员在GPS欺骗攻击下的行为反应，填补了GPS欺骗研究中人为因素的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPS欺骗研究多关注技术检测和缓解，但忽视了飞行员作为飞机操作关键组成部分的人为因素漏洞。

Method: 使用Force Dynamics 401CR飞行模拟器和X-Plane 11，在Cessna 172飞机上实施GPS欺骗场景，观察30名不同经验水平的学生飞行员在欺骗攻击下的决策行为。

Result: 收集了飞行员对异常的反应时间、视觉注意力分布、认知偏差以及工作负荷等数据。

Conclusion: 该研究为识别GPS依赖背景下的人类脆弱性提供了初步探索，有助于理解GPS欺骗对航空导航的潜在影响。

Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing involves transmitting fake signals
that mimic those from GPS satellites, causing the GPS receivers to calculate
incorrect Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information. Recently,
there has been a surge in GPS spoofing attacks targeting aircraft. Since GPS
satellite signals are weak, the spoofed high-power signal can easily overpower
them. These spoofed signals are often interpreted as valid by the GPS receiver,
which can cause severe and cascading effects on air navigation. While much of
the existing research on GPS spoofing focuses on technical aspects of detection
and mitigation, human factors are often neglected, even though pilots are an
integral part of aircraft operation and potentially vulnerable to deception.
This research addresses this gap by conducting a detailed analysis of the
behavior of student pilots when subjected to GPS spoofing using the Force
Dynamics 401CR flight simulator with X-Plane 11 and a Cessna 172 equipped with
Garmin G1000. Spoofing scenarios were implemented via custom scripts that
altered navigational data without modifying the external visual environment.
Thirty student pilots from the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona
Beach campus with diverse flying experience levels were recruited to
participate in three spoofing scenarios. A pre-simulation questionnaire was
distributed to measure pilot experience and confidence in GPS.Inflight
decision-making during the spoofing attacks was observed, including reaction
time to anomalies, visual attention to interface elements, and cognitive
biases. A post-flight evaluation of workload was obtained using a modified NASA
Task Load Index (TLX) method. This study provides a first step toward
identifying human vulnerabilities to GPS spoofing amid the ongoing debate over
GPS reliance.

Motivation: 现代身份中心化项目中需要量化安全性与操作摩擦之间的权衡，为Zero Trust身份策略决策提供可操作的工具。

Method: 引入SFQ复合指数，结合残余风险估计和经验性摩擦项(延迟、失败率、帮助台影响)，通过蒙特卡洛模拟评估条件访问策略，并进行实际观察验证。

Result: 在12周评估期内，SFQ框架显示出95.5%的策略排序稳定性，实际观察结果与模拟的防钓鱼MFA增益方向一致。

Conclusion: SFQ框架具有可重现性、可解释性和直接可操作性，支持身份策略的设计、审查和持续改进。

Abstract: We define a practical method to quantify the trade-off between security and
operational friction in modern identity-centric programs. We introduce the
Security Friction Quotient (SFQ), a bounded composite index that combines a
residual-risk estimator with empirically grounded friction terms (latency,
failure rate, and helpdesk impact). We establish clarity properties
(boundedness, monotonic response, and weight identifiability) with short
proofs, then evaluate widely used Conditional Access policies over a 12-week
horizon using Monte Carlo simulation (n = 2,000 runs per policy/scenario) with
effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. We further assess rank stability
under 10,000 random weight draws, finding 95.5% preservation of policy
ordering. Finally, we provide a 12-week passkey field observation from an
enterprise-scale cohort (N = 1,200) that directionally aligns with the
simulation's phishing-resistant MFA gains. The SFQ framework is designed to be
reproducible, interpretable, and directly actionable for Zero Trust identity
policy decisions, with artifacts and parameter ranges provided to support
policy design, review, and continuous improvement.

Abstract: As Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) became a useful device and rose as an
interesting research topic but remained expensive, multiple PLC
simulators/emulators were introduced for various purposes. Open-source
Programmable Logic Controller (OpenPLC) software, one of the most popular PLC
simulators, is designed to be vendor-neutral and run on almost any computer or
low-cost embedded devices, e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other controllers.
The project succeeded in introducing itself as an affordable and practical
solution for the high cost of real hardware PLCs. However, it still lacks
appropriate securing methods, resulting in several vulnerabilities. Through a
combination of threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, and practical
experiments, this thesis provides valuable insights for developers,
researchers, and engineers aiming to deploy OpenPLC securely in industrial
environments. To this end, this work first conducts an in-depth analysis aimed
to shed light on va! rious security challenges and vulnerabilities within the
OpenPLC project. After that, an advanced control logic injection attack was
performed. This attack modifies the user program maliciously, exploiting
presented vulnerabilities. Finally, the work introduces a security-enhanced
OpenPLC software called OpenPLC Aqua. The new software is equipped with a set
of security solutions designed specifically to address the vulnerabilities to
which current OpenPLC versions are prone.

Method: BIID方法整合前向请求意图推理和后向响应意图回溯，建立双向协同机制来检测看似良性输入中隐藏的风险，构建更强大的安全护栏。

Result: 在3个LLM和2个安全基准上的10种攻击方法测试表明，该方法显著降低单轮和多轮越狱攻击成功率，优于所有现有基线方法，同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: BIID方法在多轮安全数据集上的比较实验进一步验证了其相对于其他防御方法的显著优势，为LLM安全防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
significant safety concerns, particularly regarding "jailbreak" attacks that
exploit adversarial prompts to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. Existing
defense research primarily focuses on single-turn attacks, whereas multi-turn
jailbreak attacks progressively break through safeguards through by concealing
malicious intent and tactical manipulation, ultimately rendering conventional
single-turn defenses ineffective. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID). The method
integrates forward request-based intention inference with backward
response-based intention retrospection, establishing a bidirectional synergy
mechanism to detect risks concealed within seemingly benign inputs, thereby
constructing a more robust guardrails that effectively prevents harmful content
generation. The proposed method undergoes systematic evaluation compared with a
no-defense baseline and seven representative defense methods across three LLMs
and two safety benchmarks under 10 different attack methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the Attack
Success Rate (ASR) across both single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attempts,
outperforming all existing baseline methods while effectively maintaining
practical utility. Notably, comparative experiments across three multi-turn
safety datasets further validate the proposed model's significant advantages
over other defense approaches.

### [41] [Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22745)
*Jaehan Kim,Minkyoo Song,Seungwon Shin,Sooel Son*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SafeMoE是一种针对MoE架构大语言模型的安全微调方法，通过惩罚微调模型与初始安全对齐模型之间的路由权重差异，有效防止有害输入路由漂移，抵御有害微调攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构的LLMs依赖将有害输入路由到安全关键专家的表面安全机制，但微调后有害输入的路由决策会发生显著漂移，暴露了对有害微调攻击的严重脆弱性。

Method: 提出SafeMoE方法，直接通过惩罚微调模型与初始安全对齐模型之间路由权重的差距来缓解路由漂移，从而保持有害输入对安全关键专家的安全对齐路由。

Result: 在7B到141B参数的MoE LLMs上实验表明，SafeMoE有效缓解HFT攻击，将OLMoE的有害性得分从62.0降至5.0，任务效用保持在1%退化内，仅产生2%开销。

Conclusion: SafeMoE显著优于现有的LLM微调保护方法，在最新的大规模MoE LLMs中保持有效，为MoE架构LLMs提供了有效的安全微调解决方案。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily
depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed
safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions
for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical
vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses,
primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they
fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we
propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE
directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing
weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model,
thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to
safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to
141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks,
reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while
maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead.
It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding
LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as
gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结构化方法来评估量子密码协议中的漏洞，重点关注BB84量子密钥分发方法和NIST批准的量子抗性算法。通过整合AI驱动的红队演练、自动化渗透测试和实时异常检测，开发了一个评估和缓解量子网络安全风险的框架。


<details>

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，量子密码协议面临新的安全挑战，需要开发有效的评估方法来识别和缓解潜在漏洞，确保量子网络的安全性。

Method: 整合AI驱动的红队演练、自动化渗透测试、实时异常检测、自动化漏洞模拟和协议模糊测试，使用对抗性机器学习技术来识别AI增强密码过程中的新攻击面。

Result: 研究发现AI能有效模拟对抗攻击、探测密码实现中的弱点，并通过迭代反馈完善安全机制。自动化漏洞模拟和协议模糊测试为识别潜在漏洞提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities
within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key
distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming,
automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research
develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum
networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate
adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and
refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated
exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of
identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning
techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic
processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening
quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven
cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.

### [43] [TRUSTCHECKPOINTS: Time Betrays Malware for Unconditional Software Root of Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22762)
*Friedrich Doku,Peter Dinda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRUSTCHECKPOINTS是首个基于形式化模型的无条件软件信任根系统，无需依赖密钥或可信硬件，通过时间约束的随机多项式挑战验证系统完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物联网和嵌入式平台建立信任根的方法依赖密钥和专用安全硬件，导致成本增加、操作复杂，且依赖对攻击者计算能力的假设。需要一种不依赖这些前提条件的信任根方案。

Method: 开发者捕获全系统检查点，之后回滚到该检查点并向外部验证器证明。验证器通过时间约束的随机k独立多项式挑战（使用Horner法则），以随机化遍历方式重复扫描快速片上内存。恶意代码尝试持久化时必须交换到较慢的片外存储，导致可检测的时间延迟。

Result: 在商用ARM Cortex-A53平台上，原型系统在约10秒内验证192KB SRAM，使用500次遍历，足以检测单指令持久化恶意软件。系统可无缝扩展信任到DRAM，提供快速SRAM引导和全面全内存扫描两种模式。

Conclusion: TRUSTCHECKPOINTS在未修改硬件上实现了可靠的恶意软件检测，提供了速度和覆盖范围之间的权衡，为物联网和嵌入式系统建立了无条件软件信任根。

Abstract: Modern IoT and embedded platforms must start execution from a known trusted
state to thwart malware, ensure secure firmware updates, and protect critical
infrastructure. Current approaches to establish a root of trust depend on
secret keys and/or specialized secure hardware, which drives up costs, may
involve third parties, adds operational complexity, and relies on assumptions
about an attacker's computational power. In contrast, TRUSTCHECKPOINTS is the
first system to establish an unconditional software root of trust based on a
formal model without relying on secrets or trusted hardware. Developers capture
a full-system checkpoint and later roll back to it and prove this to an
external verifier. The verifier issues timing-constrained, randomized
k-independent polynomial challenges (via Horner's rule) that repeatedly scan
the fast on-chip memory in randomized passes. When malicious code attempts to
persist, it must swap into slower, unchecked off-chip storage, causing a
detectable timing delay.
  Our prototype for a commodity ARM Cortex-A53-based platform validates 192 KB
of SRAM in approximately 10 s using 500 passes, sufficient to detect
single-instruction persistent malware. The prototype then seamlessly extends
trust to DRAM. Two modes (fast SRAM-bootstrap and comprehensive full-memory
scan) allow trade-offs between speed and coverage, demonstrating reliable
malware detection on unmodified hardware.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了DUALLM方法，通过结合大语言模型和微调小语言模型，显著提高了Linux内核安全补丁的分类准确性，能够有效识别边界外访问和使用后释放漏洞补丁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linux内核安全补丁在下游维护者中延迟采用，主要原因是难以识别安全关键补丁，特别是针对可被利用的漏洞。现有分类方法在覆盖范围和准确性方面存在局限。

Method: 开发了DUALLM双方法管道，利用提交标题/消息和差异信息，结合适当的代码上下文，集成基于大语言模型和微调小语言模型的两种方法。

Result: DUALLM达到87.4%的准确率和0.875的F1分数，显著优于先前解决方案。在5140个最近Linux内核补丁中成功识别出111个处理OOB或UAF漏洞的补丁，其中90个经手动验证为真阳性。

Conclusion: DUALLM能够有效识别Linux内核中的安全关键补丁，特别是那些没有明确描述的安全漏洞修复，有助于减少下游维护者的漏洞窗口期。

Abstract: Open-source software projects are foundational to modern software ecosystems,
with the Linux kernel standing out as a critical exemplar due to its ubiquity
and complexity. Although security patches are continuously integrated into the
Linux mainline kernel, downstream maintainers often delay their adoption,
creating windows of vulnerability. A key reason for this lag is the difficulty
in identifying security-critical patches, particularly those addressing
exploitable vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and
use-after-free (UAF) bugs. This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally
silent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE
issuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux
kernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit
limitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously
unexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch
classification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages
and diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method
pipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM)
and a fine-tuned small language model. DUALLM achieves 87.4% accuracy and an
F1-score of 0.875, significantly outperforming prior solutions. Notably, DUALLM
successfully identified 111 of 5,140 recent Linux kernel patches as addressing
OOB or UAF vulnerabilities, with 90 true positives confirmed by manual
verification (many do not have clear indications in patch descriptions).
Moreover, we constructed proof-of-concepts for two identified bugs (one UAF and
one OOB), including one developed to conduct a previously unknown control-flow
hijack as further evidence of the correctness of the classification.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 对91个公开注册的视觉中心MCP服务器进行首次协议级审计，发现模式格式分歧、运行时验证缺失、坐标约定未声明等系统性问题，开发了可执行基准测试和验证器来检测协议违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP定义了代理-工具交互的模式绑定执行模型，但缺乏部署规模的协议级审计，需要识别视觉系统中的系统性弱点。

Method: 分析91个公开MCP服务器，沿9个组合保真度维度进行标注，开发包含验证器的可执行基准测试来检测协议违规。

Result: 模式格式检查在78.0%系统中检测到不一致，坐标约定检查在24.6%系统中发现空间参考错误，内存范围检查每100次执行平均发出33.8个警告。

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试和验证器套件为测量和改进组合视觉工作流的可靠性和安全性建立了可复现框架。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a schema bound execution model for
agent-tool interaction, enabling modular computer vision workflows without
retraining. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol level, deployment
scale audit of MCP in vision systems, identifying systemic weaknesses in schema
semantics, interoperability, and runtime coordination. We analyze 91 publicly
registered vision centric MCP servers, annotated along nine dimensions of
compositional fidelity, and develop an executable benchmark with validators to
detect and categorize protocol violations. The audit reveals high prevalence of
schema format divergence, missing runtime schema validation, undeclared
coordinate conventions, and reliance on untracked bridging scripts. Validator
based testing quantifies these failures, with schema format checks flagging
misalignments in 78.0 percent of systems, coordinate convention checks
detecting spatial reference errors in 24.6 percent, and memory scope checks
issuing an average of 33.8 warnings per 100 executions. Security probes show
that dynamic and multi agent workflows exhibit elevated risks of privilege
escalation and untyped tool connections. The proposed benchmark and validator
suite, implemented in a controlled testbed and to be released on GitHub,
establishes a reproducible framework for measuring and improving the
reliability and security of compositional vision workflows.

*Eduardo Chielle,Manaar Alam,Jinting Liu,Jovan Kascelan,Michail Maniatakos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于全同态加密的隐私保护推理方法，通过二次多项式逼近ReLU激活函数、结构优化和参数聚类等技术，在ResNet模型上实现了与明文ReLU模型相当的精度，同时推理速度比现有方法快4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于FHE的隐私保护推理方法存在两个主要问题：依赖昂贵的bootstrapping操作导致推理速度慢，以及使用高次多项式逼近非线性激活函数导致精度下降2-5%。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用二次多项式逼近ReLU激活函数（达到理论最小乘法深度）、基于惩罚的训练策略、结构优化（节点融合、权重重分配、塔重用）、参数聚类以及数据编码布局和集成技术的联合策略。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的ResNet-18、ResNet-20和ResNet-32实验表明，该方法比现有工作快4倍，且精度与明文ReLU模型相当，FHE级别需求减少了近5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法成功缩小了基于FHE的非交互式隐私保护推理与明文模型之间的精度差距，同时显著提升了推理速度，无需bootstrapping即可运行ResNet模型。

Abstract: Recent work has made non-interactive privacy-preserving inference more
practical by running deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with Fully
Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). However, these methods remain limited by their
reliance on bootstrapping, a costly FHE operation applied across multiple
layers, severely slowing inference. They also depend on high-degree polynomial
approximations of non-linear activations, which increase multiplicative depth
and reduce accuracy by 2-5% compared to plaintext ReLU models. In this work, we
focus on ResNets, a widely adopted benchmark architecture in privacy-preserving
inference, and close the accuracy gap between their FHE-based non-interactive
models and plaintext counterparts, while also achieving faster inference than
existing methods. We use a quadratic polynomial approximation of ReLU, which
achieves the theoretical minimum multiplicative depth for non-linear
activations, along with a penalty-based training strategy. We further introduce
structural optimizations such as node fusing, weight redistribution, and tower
reuse. These optimizations reduce the required FHE levels in CNNs by nearly a
factor of five compared to prior work, allowing us to run ResNet models under
leveled FHE without bootstrapping. To further accelerate inference and recover
accuracy typically lost with polynomial approximations, we introduce parameter
clustering along with a joint strategy of data encoding layout and ensemble
techniques. Experiments with ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32 on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 show that our approach achieves up to 4x faster private inference
than prior work with comparable accuracy to plaintext ReLU models.

TL;DR: AntiFLipper是一种针对联邦学习中标签翻转攻击的新型防御方法，通过客户端检测策略显著降低服务器计算负担，在保持高准确率的同时大幅提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但仍易受标签翻转攻击影响，现有防御方法计算开销过大，需要在安全性和效率之间找到平衡。

Method: 采用新颖的客户端检测策略，在客户端层面识别和防御标签翻转攻击，减轻服务器聚合时的计算负担。

Result: 在多种数据集和分布条件下，AntiFLipper实现了与最先进防御方法相当的准确率，同时显著减少了服务器端的计算资源需求。

Conclusion: AntiFLipper填补了现有防御方法的空白，特别适合资源受限的联邦学习部署场景，在保证模型完整性的同时提升运行效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving model training by keeping
data decentralized. However, it remains vulnerable to label-flipping attacks,
where malicious clients manipulate labels to poison the global model. Despite
their simplicity, these attacks can severely degrade model performance, and
defending against them remains challenging. We introduce AntiFLipper, a novel
and computationally efficient defense against multi-class label-flipping
attacks in FL. Unlike existing methods that ensure security at the cost of high
computational overhead, AntiFLipper employs a novel client-side detection
strategy, significantly reducing the central server's burden during
aggregation. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets under
different distributions demonstrate that AntiFLipper achieves accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art defenses while requiring substantially fewer
computational resources in server side. By balancing security and efficiency,
AntiFLipper addresses a critical gap in existing defenses, making it
particularly suitable for resource-constrained FL deployments where both model
integrity and operational efficiency are essential.

Motivation: 冗长复杂的隐私政策阻碍用户理解移动应用如何收集和处理个人数据，现有上下文隐私政策方法无法在实际移动环境中部署。

Method: 采用远程部署架构，将多模态后端管道与移动客户端分离，包含五个模块化组件，通过实时截图识别GUI元素与个人数据的关联。

Conclusion: PrivScan提供了一个可部署的解决方案，降低了设备资源需求并提高了跨平台可移植性，使上下文隐私政策在实际移动环境中变得可行。

Abstract: Lengthy and legally phrased privacy policies impede users' understanding of
how mobile applications collect and process personal data. Prior work proposed
Contextual Privacy Policies (CPPs) for mobile apps to display shorter policy
snippets only in the corresponding user interface contexts, but the pipeline
could not be deployable in real-world mobile environments. In this paper, we
present PrivScan, the first deployable CPP Software Development Kit (SDK) for
Android. It captures live app screenshots to identify GUI elements associated
with types of personal data and displays CPPs in a concise, user-facing format.
We provide a lightweight floating button that offers low-friction, on-demand
control. The architecture leverages remote deployment to decouple the
multimodal backend pipeline from a mobile client comprising five modular
components, thereby reducing on-device resource demands and easing
cross-platform portability. A feasibility-oriented evaluation shows an average
execution time of 9.15\,s, demonstrating the practicality of our approach. The

Abstract: Casting a ballot from a phone or laptop sounds appealing, but only if voters
can be confident their choice remains secret and results cannot be altered in
the dark. This paper proposes a hybrid blockchain-based voting model that
stores encrypted votes on a private blockchain maintained by election
organizers and neutral observers, while periodically anchoring hashes of these
votes onto a public blockchain as a tamper-evident seal. The system issues
voters one-time blind-signed tokens to protect anonymity, and provides receipts
so they can confirm their vote was counted. We implemented a live prototype
using common web technologies (Next.js, React, Firebase) to demonstrate
end-to-end functionality, accessibility, and cost efficiency. Our contributions
include developing a working demo, a complete election workflow, a hybrid
blockchain design, and a user-friendly interface that balances privacy,
security, transparency, and practicality. This research highlights the
feasibility of secure, verifiable, and scalable online voting for organizations
ranging from small groups to larger institutions.

TL;DR: CryptoSRAM是一种在SRAM内存中直接执行加密操作的架构，通过消除内存和处理单元之间的数据传输瓶颈，显著提升了MCU上加密操作的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于软件库或专用硬件加速器的加密解决方案受限于内存和处理单元之间的数据传输性能与能耗成本，这在物联网设备中尤为突出。

Method: 利用MCU的标准SRAM阵列，将其重新配置为大规模并行处理结构，直接在内存中执行加密操作，通过物理寻址和DMA实现无缝集成。

Result: 对于常见的加密核心算法，CryptoSRAM相比软件实现，AES和SHA3的吞吐量分别提升高达74倍和67倍；相比现有硬件加速器，AES吞吐量提升高达6倍。

Conclusion: CryptoSRAM为下一代物联网系统的安全通信提供了一种可行且高效的架构解决方案。

Abstract: Secure communication is a critical requirement for Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, which are often based on Microcontroller Units (MCUs). Current
cryptographic solutions, which rely on software libraries or dedicated hardware
accelerators, are fundamentally limited by the performance and energy costs of
data movement between memory and processing units. This paper introduces
CryptoSRAM, an in-SRAM computing architecture that performs cryptographic
operations directly within the MCU's standard SRAM array. By repurposing the
memory array into a massively parallel processing fabric, CryptoSRAM eliminates
the data movement bottleneck. This approach is well-suited to MCUs, which
utilize physical addressing and Direct Memory Access (DMA) to manage SRAM,
allowing for seamless integration with minimal hardware overhead. Our analysis
shows that for common cryptographic kernels, CryptoSRAM achieves throughput
improvements of up to 74$\times$ and 67$\times$ for AES and SHA3, respectively,
compared to a software implementation. Furthermore, our solution delivers up to
6$\times$ higher throughput than existing hardware accelerators for AES.
CryptoSRAM demonstrates a viable and efficient architecture for secure
communication in next-generation IoT systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然水印技术在良性环境下有效，但其在对抗性逃避下的鲁棒性仍存在争议，需要对这些漏洞进行严格理解和评估。

Method: 提出BIRA攻击方法，这是一种理论驱动且模型无关的方法，通过在基于LLM的重写过程中抑制可能被水印标记的logits来削弱水印信号。

Result: 在最近的水印方法中，BIRA实现了超过99%的逃避率，同时保持了原始文本的语义内容。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了系统性漏洞，强调了压力测试和鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal
during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While
watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under
adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and
evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion
Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic.
BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely
watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the
underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA
achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the
original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic
vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了合成数据集成训练对LLM的安全性影响，发现该范式对现有中毒和后门攻击具有强抵抗力，并提出了一种新的病毒感染攻击框架VIA，能显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽然能显著提升大语言模型的性能，但其可能引入的安全风险尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在系统评估合成数据集成训练范式对主流中毒和后门攻击的抵抗力。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的通用攻击框架VIA，受网络安全中病毒设计原理启发，将中毒载荷隐藏在保护性"外壳"中，并在良性样本中战略性地搜索最佳劫持点以最大化生成恶意内容的可能性。

Result: 实验表明，VIA显著增加了合成数据中的中毒内容存在，并将下游模型的攻击成功率提高到与上游中毒模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: 合成数据集成训练虽然对现有攻击具有抵抗力，但通过VIA攻击框架仍存在严重安全风险，需要进一步关注和防护。

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has
been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language
models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development,
potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper
systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training
paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal
that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily
thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and
queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of
these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by
synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely,
Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks
through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the
principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload
within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking
points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious
content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show
that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic
data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream
models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) effectively
safeguards data privacy during model aggregation by encrypting local model
updates before transmission, mitigating threats from untrusted servers or
eavesdroppers in transmission. However, the computational burden and ciphertext
expansion associated with homomorphic encryption can significantly increase
resource and communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedBit, a hardware/software co-designed framework optimized for the
Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme. FedBit employs bit-interleaved data
packing to embed multiple model parameters into a single ciphertext
coefficient, thereby minimizing ciphertext expansion and maximizing
computational parallelism. Additionally, we integrate a dedicated FPGA
accelerator to handle cryptographic operations and an optimized dataflow to
reduce the memory overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that FedBit
achieves a speedup of two orders of magnitude in encryption and lowers average
communication overhead by 60.7%, while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: ICS-SimLab是一个基于Docker容器化技术的可配置工业控制系统仿真环境，能够快速构建不同ICS架构，用于开发跨系统的安全解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业环境向互联网服务发展，ICS面临日益增长的攻击风险，需要特定入侵检测系统。现有测试平台通常只使用有限的虚拟ICS仿真，缺乏能够高效模拟多种ICS架构的系统。

Method: 利用Docker容器化技术创建高度可配置的ICS仿真环境，支持快速构建和定制不同的ICS环境，遵循普渡企业参考架构。

Result: 开发了三个虚拟ICS仿真：太阳能智能电网、水瓶灌装设施和智能电子设备系统，并运行网络攻击构建了包含恶意和良性网络流量的数据集。

Conclusion: ICS-SimLab提供了一个端到端的软件套件，能够促进跨不同系统的安全解决方案开发，解决了现有研究中因仅使用单一ICS仿真而导致的架构偏见问题。

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are complex interconnected systems used to
manage process control within industrial environments, such as chemical
processing plants and water treatment facilities. As the modern industrial
environment moves towards Internet-facing services, ICSs face an increased risk
of attacks that necessitates ICS-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
The development of such IDS relies significantly on a simulated testbed as it
is unrealistic and sometimes hazardous to utilize an operational control
system. Whilst some testbeds have been proposed, they often use a limited
selection of virtual ICS simulations to test and verify cyber security
solutions. There is a lack of investigation done on developing systems that can
efficiently simulate multiple ICS architectures. Currently, the trend within
research involves developing security solutions on just one ICS simulation,
which can result in bias to its specific architecture. We present ICS-SimLab,
an end-to-end software suite that utilizes Docker containerization technology
to create a highly configurable ICS simulation environment. This software
framework enables researchers to rapidly build and customize different ICS
environments, facilitating the development of security solutions across
different systems that adhere to the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture.
To demonstrate its capability, we present three virtual ICS simulations: a
solar panel smart grid, a water bottle filling facility, and a system of
intelligent electronic devices. Furthermore, we run cyber-attacks on these
simulations and construct a dataset of recorded malicious and benign network
traffic to be used for IDS development.

*Ummay Kulsum,Aafaq Sabir,Abhinaya S. B.,Anupam Das*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地探索了多模态方法在YouTube诈骗检测中的应用，通过整合文本、音频和视觉信息，构建了包含完整视频内容和基于政策推理标注的数据集，实现了比单一模态更高的检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YouTube作为主要信息传播平台，已成为诈骗内容的温床。现有检测方法主要依赖文本或统计元数据，容易被规避且忽略了视觉等多模态线索，需要更全面的检测方法。

Method: 构建包含完整视频内容和政策推理标注的数据集，分别评估文本模型（BERT）、音频转录、视觉模型（LLaVA-Video）的性能，最终开发整合标题、描述和视频帧的多模态框架。

Result: 文本模型F1为76.61%，加入音频后提升至77.98%，视觉模型达到79.61%，多模态框架表现最佳，F1达到80.53%，并在6,374个真实视频上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态方法显著提升了YouTube诈骗检测的准确率，同时提供了基于内容政策的可解释推理，增强了透明度，为自动化内容审核提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: YouTube has emerged as a dominant platform for both information dissemination
and entertainment. However, its vast accessibility has also made it a target
for scammers, who frequently upload deceptive or malicious content. Prior
research has documented a range of scam types, and detection approaches rely
primarily on textual or statistical metadata. Although effective to some
extent, these signals are easy to evade and potentially overlook other
modalities, such as visual cues.
  In this study, we present the first systematic investigation of multimodal
approaches for YouTube scam detection. Our dataset consolidates established
scam categories and augments them with full length video content and policy
grounded reasoning annotations. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that a
text-only model using video titles and descriptions (fine-tuned BERT) achieves
moderate effectiveness (76.61% F1), with modest improvements when incorporating
audio transcripts (77.98% F1). In contrast, visual analysis using a fine-tuned
LLaVA-Video model yields stronger results (79.61% F1). Finally, a multimodal
framework that integrates titles, descriptions, and video frames achieves the
highest performance (80.53% F1). Beyond improving detection accuracy, our
multimodal framework produces interpretable reasoning grounded in YouTube
content policies, thereby enhancing transparency and supporting potential
applications in automated moderation. Moreover, we validate our approach on
in-the-wild YouTube data by analyzing 6,374 videos, thereby contributing a
valuable resource for future research on scam detection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: StarveSpam是一个基于信誉的去中心化协议，通过在交易中继层操作来缓解区块链网络中的垃圾交易问题，结合本地行为跟踪、对等评分和自适应速率限制来抑制恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链网络面临日益严重的垃圾交易威胁，现有基于经济威慑的防御方法无法区分恶意和合法用户，往往排除低价值但诚实的活动。

Method: StarveSpam结合本地行为跟踪、对等评分和自适应速率限制，在交易中继层操作，无需全局共识、协议更改或可信基础设施。

Result: 使用真实以太坊数据评估显示，StarveSpam能阻止超过95%的垃圾交易，仅丢弃3%的诚实流量，与现有基于规则的方法相比，将网络暴露于垃圾交易的比例降低了85%。

Conclusion: StarveSpam为传统垃圾交易防御提供了可扩展且可部署的替代方案，为构建更具弹性和公平性的区块链基础设施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Spam poses a growing threat to blockchain networks. Adversaries can easily
create multiple accounts to flood transaction pools, inflating fees and
degrading service quality. Existing defenses against spam, such as fee markets
and staking requirements, primarily rely on economic deterrence, which fails to
distinguish between malicious and legitimate users and often exclude low-value
but honest activity. To address these shortcomings, we present StarveSpam, a
decentralized reputation-based protocol that mitigates spam by operating at the
transaction relay layer. StarveSpam combines local behavior tracking, peer
scoring, and adaptive rate-limiting to suppress abusive actors, without
requiring global consensus, protocol changes, or trusted infrastructure. We
evaluate StarveSpam using real Ethereum data from a major NFT spam event and
show that it outperforms existing fee-based and rule-based defenses, allowing
each node to block over 95% of spam while dropping just 3% of honest traffic,
and reducing the fraction of the network exposed to spam by 85% compared to
existing rule-based methods. StarveSpam offers a scalable and deployable
alternative to traditional spam defenses, paving the way toward more resilient
and equitable blockchain infrastructure.

TL;DR: MaskSQL是一个文本到SQL框架，使用抽象作为隐私保护机制来掩盖LLM提示中的敏感信息，在保持隐私的同时实现接近最先进LLM模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在推理任务中表现出色，但存在隐私问题、成本高且资源密集。小型语言模型(SLMs)虽然可以本地部署缓解隐私问题，但在复杂任务如文本到SQL转换中表现不佳。

Method: 引入MaskSQL框架，使用抽象作为隐私保护机制来掩盖敏感信息。与完全删除内容的编辑或扩大标记的泛化不同，抽象保留基本信息同时丢弃不必要细节，实现隐私与效用的平衡。

Result: 实验结果显示MaskSQL优于领先的基于SLM的文本到SQL模型，性能接近最先进的基于LLM的模型，同时保持隐私。

Conclusion: MaskSQL通过抽象机制在文本到SQL任务中实现了有效的隐私-效用平衡，为更广泛的应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that
require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging.
However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their
integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary,
costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical.
Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party
providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations.
Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain
tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform
on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we
introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a
privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts.
Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which
broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding
unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the
text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the
privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range
of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading
SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching
state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

TL;DR: ReliabilityRAG是一个增强RAG系统对抗性鲁棒性的框架，通过利用检索文档的可靠性信息来过滤恶意文档，提供可证明的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统容易受到检索语料库攻击（如提示注入），特别是在基于RAG的搜索系统中，需要利用内置可靠性信号（如文档排名）来防御此类威胁。

Method: 采用图论视角识别检索文档中的"一致多数"来过滤恶意文档，基于最大独立集算法，优先考虑高可靠性文档；同时提出可扩展的加权采样聚合框架来处理大规模检索集。

Result: 实验结果显示ReliabilityRAG在对抗性攻击下提供优于先前方法的鲁棒性，保持高良性准确率，在长文本生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该工作是朝着在RAG中实现更有效、可证明鲁棒的防御机制的重要一步，能够有效抵御检索语料库的污染攻击。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by
grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain
vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection.
RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an
interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as
defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like
document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to
decades of work to thwart SEO.
  Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces
ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly
leverages reliability information of retrieved documents.
  Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a
"consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones.
We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS)
on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant
explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable
robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural
assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large
retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and
aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving
some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents.
  We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior
robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains
high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior
robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards
more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in
RAG.

TL;DR: CyberTeam是一个为蓝队威胁狩猎设计的基准框架，通过标准化的两阶段工作流程指导LLMs进行威胁分析，包含30个任务和9个操作模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络威胁规模和复杂性的增长，蓝队防御者需要先进工具来主动检测和缓解风险。LLMs在威胁分析方面具有潜力，但它们在真实蓝队威胁狩猎场景中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: CyberTeam构建标准化工作流程：第一阶段模拟真实威胁狩猎工作流程，捕获从威胁归因到事件响应的分析任务依赖关系；第二阶段通过针对特定分析需求的操作模块处理每个任务，将威胁狩猎转化为结构化的推理步骤序列。

Result: 评估显示，与开放式推理策略相比，标准化设计带来了改进，同时揭示了开放式推理在真实威胁狩猎中的局限性。

Conclusion: CyberTeam框架通过模块化步骤指导LLMs执行威胁狩猎任务，整合了30个任务和9个操作模块，为标准化威胁分析提供了有效指导。

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team
defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and
mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for
enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team
threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents
CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice.
CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models
realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among
analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task
is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific
analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured
sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation
and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework,
LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps.
Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs
through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and
state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended
reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by
standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended
reasoning in real-world threat hunting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs被广泛用于支持网络安全分析，但在实际部署中存在显著的性能差距。本文旨在研究CTI领域中LLMs的内在脆弱性，这些挑战源于威胁态势本身而非模型架构。

Method: 采用大规模评估，跨越多个CTI基准和真实威胁报告，引入了一种新颖的分类方法，整合了分层、自回归细化和人在回路监督，以可靠分析失败实例。

Result: 通过广泛实验和人工检查，揭示了三个根本性漏洞：伪相关（spurious correlations）、矛盾知识（contradictory knowledge）和受限泛化（constrained generalization）。

Conclusion: 为设计更强大的LLM驱动的CTI系统提供了可行的见解，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts
in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer
cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and
incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide
range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and
intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical
deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of
LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat
landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale
evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we
introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification,
autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably
analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections,
we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations,
contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in
effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for
designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对LoRA适配模型的新型模型提取攻击方法StolenLoRA，该方法使用合成数据和半监督学习策略，仅需少量查询即可高效提取LoRA模型功能，揭示了PEFT方法的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA等参数高效微调方法虽然提升了视觉模型适配效率，但其紧凑性带来了新的安全隐患，特别是对模型提取攻击的脆弱性。本文旨在研究LoRA适配模型面临的提取攻击风险。

Method: 提出StolenLoRA攻击方法：1) 使用大语言模型生成有效的提示来创建合成数据；2) 采用基于分歧的半监督学习策略从有限查询中最大化信息获取；3) 训练替代模型来提取LoRA适配模型的功能。

Result: 实验显示StolenLoRA攻击效果显著，仅用1万次查询即可达到96.60%的攻击成功率，即使在攻击者和受害者模型使用不同预训练骨干网络的跨骨干场景下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LoRA适配模型对提取攻击的特定脆弱性，强调了为PEFT方法定制鲁棒防御机制的迫切需求，并探索了基于多样化LoRA部署的初步防御策略。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have transformed
vision model adaptation, enabling the rapid deployment of customized models.
However, the compactness of LoRA adaptations introduces new safety concerns,
particularly their vulnerability to model extraction attacks. This paper
introduces a new focus of model extraction attacks named LoRA extraction that
extracts LoRA-adaptive models based on a public pre-trained model. We then
propose a novel extraction method called StolenLoRA which trains a substitute
model to extract the functionality of a LoRA-adapted model using synthetic
data. StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts
for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised
Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a
96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone
scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained
backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted
models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust
defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary
defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its
potential to mitigate such attacks.

Motivation: 探索AutoML在复杂网络安全领域的可靠性，当前该领域的研究仍不足，需要系统评估AutoML框架在实际安全应用中的表现。

Method: 使用8个开源AutoML框架在11个公开网络安全数据集上进行系统性评估，涵盖入侵检测、恶意软件分类、钓鱼、欺诈检测和垃圾邮件过滤等多个安全任务。

Result: 不同工具和数据集间存在显著性能差异，没有单一解决方案始终最优；AutoML工具倾向于选择基于树的模型，虽然性能良好但存在过拟合和可解释性限制的风险。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
automating machine learning (ML) pipeline design, broadening AI adoption. Yet
its reliability in complex domains such as cybersecurity remains underexplored.
This paper systematically evaluates eight open-source AutoML frameworks across
11 publicly available cybersecurity datasets, spanning intrusion detection,
malware classification, phishing, fraud detection, and spam filtering. Results
show substantial performance variability across tools and datasets, with no
single solution consistently superior. A paradigm shift is observed: the
challenge has moved from selecting individual ML models to identifying the most
suitable AutoML framework, complicated by differences in runtime efficiency,
automation capabilities, and supported features. AutoML tools frequently favor
tree-based models, which perform well but risk overfitting and limit
interpretability. Key challenges identified include adversarial vulnerability,
model drift, and inadequate feature engineering. We conclude with best
practices and research directions to strengthen robustness, interpretability,
and trust in AutoML for high-stakes cybersecurity applications.

Method: 收集10款主流语音助手应用，分析其操作特性，并交叉检查6个来源（隐私标签、政策、清单文件等）的隐私声明一致性。

Result: 发现隐私声明存在广泛不一致性，识别出三大隐私威胁模型，包括超级应用隐私披露不足、权限提升和系统应用滥用。

Abstract: With the development of foundation AI technologies, task-executable voice
assistants (VAs) have become more popular, enhancing user convenience and
expanding device functionality. Android task-executable VAs are applications
that are capable of understanding complex tasks and performing corresponding
operations. Given their prevalence and great autonomy, there is no existing
work examine the privacy risks within the voice assistants from the
task-execution pattern in a holistic manner. To fill this research gap, this
paper presents a user-centric comprehensive empirical study on privacy risks in
Android task-executable VA applications. We collect ten mainstream VAs as our
research target and analyze their operational characteristics. We then
cross-check their privacy declarations across six sources, including privacy
labels, policies, and manifest files, and our findings reveal widespread
inconsistencies. Moreover, we uncover three significant privacy threat models:
(1) privacy misdisclosure in mega apps, where integrated mini apps such as
Alexa skills are inadequately represented; (2) privilege escalation via
inter-application interactions, which exploit Android's communication
mechanisms to bypass user consent; and (3) abuse of Google system applications,
enabling apps to evade the declaration of dangerous permissions. Our study
contributes actionable recommendations for practitioners and underscores
broader relevance of these privacy risks to emerging autonomous AI agents.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私机制假设正确实现和执行，但实际中常因数值问题和配置不当导致隐私泄露。研究能否将这些被动缺陷转化为主动的隐蔽隐私攻击。

Method: 设计高斯煎饼机制(GPM)，在计算上与标准高斯机制不可区分，但统计上提供任意弱的差分隐私保证。通过形式化证明其隐蔽性，并理论分析和实证验证其区分攻击效果。

Result: GPM能够以近乎完美的成功率实现隐蔽的隐私降级攻击，在合适参数选择下既能保持计算不可区分性，又能显著削弱统计隐私保护。

Conclusion: 研究强调了使用透明开源差分隐私库的重要性，需要对DP实现进行严格审查和形式化验证，以防止现实系统中微妙且不可检测的隐私泄露。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for preserving
individual privacy in data analysis. However, an implicit yet fundamental
assumption underlying these rigorous privacy guarantees is the correct
implementation and execution of DP mechanisms. Several incidents of unintended
privacy loss have occurred due to numerical issues and inappropriate
configurations of DP software, which have been successfully exploited in
privacy attacks. To better understand the seriousness of defective DP software,
we ask the following question: is it possible to elevate these passive defects
into active privacy attacks while maintaining covertness?
  To address this question, we present the Gaussian pancake mechanism (GPM), a
novel mechanism that is computationally indistinguishable from the widely used
Gaussian mechanism (GM), yet exhibits arbitrarily weaker statistical DP
guarantees. This unprecedented separation enables a new class of backdoor
attacks: by indistinguishably passing off as the authentic GM, GPM can covertly
degrade statistical privacy. Unlike the unintentional privacy loss caused by
GM's numerical issues, GPM is an adversarial yet undetectable backdoor attack
against data privacy. We formally prove GPM's covertness, characterize its
statistical leakage, and demonstrate a concrete distinguishing attack that can
achieve near-perfect success rates under suitable parameter choices, both
theoretically and empirically.
  Our results underscore the importance of using transparent, open-source DP
libraries and highlight the need for rigorous scrutiny and formal verification
of DP implementations to prevent subtle, undetectable privacy compromises in
real-world systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为蒸馏条件后门攻击（DCBA）的新型威胁，通过双层优化方法SCAR在教师模型中植入休眠后门，这些后门在知识蒸馏过程中会被激活到学生模型中，即使使用干净数据集也难以检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏技术被广泛用于在资源受限设备上部署深度神经网络，但第三方平台提供的教师模型可能存在安全风险。现有安全验证（如后门检测）无法发现这种新型威胁，因此需要研究蒸馏过程中的条件后门攻击。

Method: 将攻击建模为双层优化问题，提出SCAR方法：内层优化通过优化代理学生模型模拟知识蒸馏过程，外层优化利用代理输出来优化教师模型以植入条件后门，使用隐式微分算法和预优化的触发器注入函数解决复杂优化问题。

Result: 在多种数据集、模型架构和知识蒸馏技术上的实验验证了SCAR的有效性，证明其能够成功植入难以检测的后门，并对现有后门检测方法具有抵抗力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了知识蒸馏过程中一个被忽视的重要安全漏洞，即使使用干净的蒸馏数据集，第三方教师模型中的休眠后门也可能在知识蒸馏过程中被激活到学生模型中，对深度学习部署安全构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from
large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from
third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor
detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional
backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into
teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process,
even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing
methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as
a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method
(\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by
optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages
outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the
conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an
implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection
function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures,
and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance
against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously
overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at

Result: 恶意软件检测精度达到0.98，召回率0.64，表现出高准确性和低误报率。恶意和良性函数之间的FSS分离度为3.0分，证实FSS分类能有效识别敏感函数。在XZ utils供应链攻击案例中成功检测到注入的后门函数。

Conclusion: 该框架结合LLM和二进制差异分析，能有效检测软件供应链中的恶意代码注入，功能性敏感度评分是识别敏感函数的有力工具。

Abstract: Security of software supply chains is necessary to ensure that software
updates do not contain maliciously injected code or introduce vulnerabilities
that may compromise the integrity of critical infrastructure. Verifying the
integrity of software updates involves binary differential analysis (binary
diffing) to highlight the changes between two binary versions by incorporating
binary analysis and reverse engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have been
applied to binary analysis to augment traditional tools by producing natural
language summaries that cybersecurity experts can grasp for further analysis.
Combining LLM-based binary code summarization with binary diffing can improve
the LLM's focus on critical changes and enable complex tasks such as automated
malware detection. To address this, we propose a novel framework for binary
diff summarization using LLMs. We introduce a novel functional sensitivity
score (FSS) that helps with automated triage of sensitive binary functions for
downstream detection tasks. We create a software supply chain security
benchmark by injecting 3 different malware into 6 open-source projects which
generates 104 binary versions, 392 binary diffs, and 46,023 functions. On this,
our framework achieves a precision of 0.98 and recall of 0.64 for malware
detection, displaying high accuracy with low false positives. Across malicious
and benign functions, we achieve FSS separation of 3.0 points, confirming that
FSS categorization can classify sensitive functions. We conduct a case study on
the real-world XZ utils supply chain attack; our framework correctly detects
the injected backdoor functions with high FSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单提议者区块链存在矿工可提取价值问题，验证者利用其串行垄断地位从用户那里提取租金。虽然应用层已有许多减少MEV影响的方案，但这些方法大多需要拍卖作为子组件

Method: 提出多并发提议者协议，提供选择性审查抵抗和隐藏属性，确保对手既不能选择性地延迟交易，也不能在交易确认前查看其内容

Result: 该协议能够有效支持链上拍卖的高效运行，解决了MEV问题中的关键挑战

Conclusion: 多并发提议者协议为解决区块链中的矿工可提取价值问题提供了有效的共识层解决方案

Abstract: Traditional single-proposer blockchains suffer from miner extractable value
(MEV), where validators exploit their serial monopoly on transaction inclusion
and ordering to extract rents from users. While there have been many
developments at the application layer to reduce the impact of MEV, these
approaches largely require auctions as a subcomponent. Running auctions
efficiently on chain requires two key properties of the underlying consensus
protocol: selective-censorship resistance and hiding. These properties
guarantee that an adversary can neither selectively delay transactions nor see
their contents before they are confirmed. We propose a multiple concurrent
proposer (MCP) protocol offering exactly these properties.

Motivation: 软件漏洞仍然是关键的安全挑战，但由于缺乏捕捉多样化漏洞利用行为的高质量数据集，限制了有效的漏洞评估和缓解。现有CVE描述存在噪声和不完整的问题。

Method: 构建端到端管道，从NVD提取CVE信息，使用RAG技术结合外部公共知识进行增强，自动化创建容器化环境和漏洞利用代码，通过迭代优化生成物并验证攻击成功率。

Result: 该方法在不同类型漏洞（内存溢出、拒绝服务、远程代码执行）上表现出有效性，跨越多种编程语言、库和年份，并揭示了CVE描述中的显著不一致性。

Conclusion: 这是首个结合通用LLM推理、CVE数据和RAG上下文增强来系统化编排和利用容器化环境中已知漏洞的系统，具有模型无关性，开源了相关成果以促进安全研究。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a critical security challenge, providing
entry points for attackers into enterprise networks. Despite advances in
security practices, the lack of high-quality datasets capturing diverse exploit
behavior limits effective vulnerability assessment and mitigation. This paper
introduces an end-to-end multi-step pipeline leveraging generative AI,
specifically large language models (LLMs), to address the challenges of
orchestrating and reproducing attacks to known software vulnerabilities. Our
approach extracts information from CVE disclosures in the National
Vulnerability Database, augments it with external public knowledge (e.g.,
threat advisories, code snippets) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and automates the creation of containerized environments and exploit code for
each vulnerability. The pipeline iteratively refines generated artifacts,
validates attack success with test cases, and supports complex multi-container
setups. Our methodology overcomes key obstacles, including noisy and incomplete
vulnerability descriptions, by integrating LLMs and RAG to fill information
gaps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline across different
vulnerability types, such as memory overflows, denial of service, and remote
code execution, spanning diverse programming languages, libraries and years. In
doing so, we uncover significant inconsistencies in CVE descriptions,
emphasizing the need for more rigorous verification in the CVE disclosure
process. Our approach is model-agnostic, working across multiple LLMs, and we
open-source the artifacts to enable reproducibility and accelerate security
research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to
systematically orchestrate and exploit known vulnerabilities in containerized
environments by combining general-purpose LLM reasoning with CVE data and
RAG-based context enrichment.

TL;DR: ENS是一个新颖的集成框架，通过顺序组合多个独立的水印实例来增强基于logits的无偏水印的可检测性和鲁棒性，同时严格保持无偏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强和广泛部署，验证机器生成内容的来源对于确保信任、安全和问责至关重要。现有无偏水印方案存在检测能力弱和鲁棒性有限的问题，特别是在短文本长度或分布扰动下。

Method: 提出ENS集成框架，顺序组合多个由不同密钥控制的独立水印实例，放大水印信号。理论上证明集成构造在期望上保持无偏，并提高统计检测器的信噪比。

Result: 在多个LLM家族上的实证评估显示，ENS显著减少了可靠检测所需的令牌数量，提高了对平滑和转述攻击的抵抗能力，且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: ENS框架有效增强了无偏水印的检测能力和鲁棒性，为机器生成内容的溯源验证提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable and widely deployed,
verifying the provenance of machine-generated content is critical to ensuring
trust, safety, and accountability. Watermarking techniques have emerged as a
promising solution by embedding imperceptible statistical signals into the
generation process. Among them, unbiased watermarking is particularly
attractive due to its theoretical guarantee of preserving the language model's
output distribution, thereby avoiding degradation in fluency or detectability
through distributional shifts. However, existing unbiased watermarking schemes
often suffer from weak detection power and limited robustness, especially under
short text lengths or distributional perturbations. In this work, we propose
ENS, a novel ensemble framework that enhances the detectability and robustness
of logits-based unbiased watermarks while strictly preserving their
unbiasedness. ENS sequentially composes multiple independent watermark
instances, each governed by a distinct key, to amplify the watermark signal. We
theoretically prove that the ensemble construction remains unbiased in
expectation and demonstrate how it improves the signal-to-noise ratio for
statistical detectors. Empirical evaluations on multiple LLM families show that
ENS substantially reduces the number of tokens needed for reliable detection
and increases resistance to smoothing and paraphrasing attacks without
compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UWbench是首个专门用于无偏水印方法评估的开源基准，通过理论分析和三轴评估协议（无偏性、可检测性、鲁棒性）为无偏水印算法提供标准化评估平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，验证AI生成文本的真实性变得日益重要。无偏水印方法虽然能保持输出分布不降低质量，但现有研究表明无偏水印在多代生成中会累积分布偏差，且现有鲁棒性评估在不同研究中存在不一致性。

Method: 提出统计指标量化多批次分布漂移，证明无偏水印在无限查询下无法完美保持分布的不可能性结果，开发针对令牌级修改攻击的鲁棒性形式分析。建立三轴评估协议：无偏性、可检测性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明令牌修改攻击比基于释义的方法提供更稳定的鲁棒性评估。UWbench为社区提供了标准化和可复现的平台。

Conclusion: UWbench通过结合理论和实证贡献，为无偏水印算法的设计和评估提供了原则性评估框架，解决了现有评估方法的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of AI-generated text has become increasingly
important with the rapid advancement of large language models, and unbiased
watermarking has emerged as a promising approach due to its ability to preserve
output distribution without degrading quality. However, recent work reveals
that unbiased watermarks can accumulate distributional bias over multiple
generations and that existing robustness evaluations are inconsistent across
studies. To address these issues, we introduce UWbench, the first open-source
benchmark dedicated to the principled evaluation of unbiased watermarking
methods. Our framework combines theoretical and empirical contributions: we
propose a statistical metric to quantify multi-batch distribution drift, prove
an impossibility result showing that no unbiased watermark can perfectly
preserve the distribution under infinite queries, and develop a formal analysis
of robustness against token-level modification attacks. Complementing this
theory, we establish a three-axis evaluation protocol: unbiasedness,
detectability, and robustness, and show that token modification attacks provide
more stable robustness assessments than paraphrasing-based methods. Together,
UWbench offers the community a standardized and reproducible platform for
advancing the design and evaluation of unbiased watermarking algorithms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用户驱动的方法来保护DNS查询隐私，通过减少对DNS服务的暴露来防止好奇的解析器收集用户活动数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共DNS解析器虽然提供低延迟和加密查询，但仍能收集大量用户活动数据。现有的加密和隐私政策无法防止解析器本身的好奇行为，需要技术保障来保护用户隐私。

Method: 采用用户驱动的方法，通过分离职责和限制每个实体可访问的数据来减少对DNS服务的暴露，同时保持低延迟和低开销。

Result: 该方法能够在不可信的DNS基础设施中实现高水平的隐私保护，同时不牺牲性能，维持低延迟、低带宽和低计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过用户驱动的方法可以在不完全信任DNS基础设施的情况下有效保护用户隐私，这是一个可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The Domain Name System (DNS) is central to all Internet user activity,
resolving accessed domain names into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. As a
result, curious DNS resolvers can learn everything about Internet users'
interests. Public DNS resolvers are rising in popularity, offering low-latency
resolution, high reliability, privacy-preserving policies, and support for
encrypted DNS queries. However, client-resolver traffic encryption,
increasingly deployed to protect users from eavesdroppers, does not protect
users against curious resolvers. Similarly, privacy-preserving policies are
based solely on written commitments and do not provide technical safeguards.
Although DNS query relay schemes can separate duties to limit data accessible
by each entity, they cannot prevent colluding entities from sharing user
traffic logs. Thus, a key challenge remains: organizations operating public DNS
resolvers, accounting for the majority of DNS resolutions, can potentially
collect and analyze massive volumes of Internet user activity data. With DNS
infrastructure that cannot be fully trusted, can we safeguard user privacy? We
answer positively and advocate for a user-driven approach to reduce exposure to
DNS services. We will discuss key ideas of the proposal, which aims to achieve
a high level of privacy without sacrificing performance: maintaining low
latency, network bandwidth, memory/storage overhead, and computational
overhead.

Method: 提出效用优化块设计(uBD)方案，结合分布分解技术和基于分数的线性估计器；在逆证明中使用广义均匀渐近Cramér-Rao下界、极值ULDP机制类和ULDP约束下的分布分解技术。

Result: 完全刻画了ULDP下的隐私-效用权衡，建立了紧致的估计精度下界，揭示了隐私保护统计推断最优机制的结构新见解。

Conclusion: 为ULDP下的估计精度提供了紧致表征，揭示了隐私保护统计推断最优机制的结构特性，对隐私保护数据统计具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study the problem of discrete distribution estimation under
utility-optimized local differential privacy (ULDP), which enforces local
differential privacy (LDP) on sensitive data while allowing more accurate
inference on non-sensitive data. In this setting, we completely characterize
the fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. The converse proof builds on several
key ideas, including a generalized uniform asymptotic Cram\'er-Rao lower bound,
a reduction showing that it suffices to consider a newly defined class of
extremal ULDP mechanisms, and a novel distribution decomposition technique
tailored to ULDP constraints. For the achievability, we propose a class of
utility-optimized block design (uBD) schemes, obtained as nontrivial
modifications of the block design mechanism known to be optimal under standard
LDP constraints, while incorporating the distribution decomposition idea used
in the converse proof and a score-based linear estimator. These results provide
a tight characterization of the estimation accuracy achievable under ULDP and
reveal new insights into the structure of optimal mechanisms for
privacy-preserving statistical inference.

<details>

Motivation: DNS系统暴露用户网络活动细节，特别是公共DNS解析器可以追踪和收集大量用户数据。现有加密方案无法解决解析器本身的隐私威胁，而DNS查询中继无法防止实体合谋。

Method: 在用户设备本地存储流行DNS记录列表，该列表通过隐私保护的客户端投票混合网络匿名更新，确保地理相关性和安全性。

Result: LLUAD能够实现接近零信任的DNS隐私保护，同时减少网页内容的访问时间，与现有DNS基础设施兼容。

Conclusion: LLUAD通过本地存储和隐私保护的投票机制，有效解决了DNS隐私问题，在保护用户隐私的同时提升了系统性能。

Abstract: The Domain Name System (DNS) is involved in practically all web activity,
translating easy-to-remember domain names into Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses. Due to its central role on the Internet, DNS exposes user web
activity in detail. The privacy challenge is honest-but-curious DNS
servers/resolvers providing the translation/lookup service. In particular, with
the majority of DNS queries handled by public DNS resolvers, the organizations
running them can track, collect, and analyze massive user activity data.
Existing solutions that encrypt DNS traffic between clients and resolvers are
insufficient, as the resolver itself is the privacy threat. While DNS query
relays separate duties among multiple entities, to limit the data accessible by
each entity, they cannot prevent colluding entities from sharing user traffic
logs. To achieve near-zero-trust DNS privacy compatible with the existing DNS
infrastructure, we propose LLUAD: it locally stores a Popularity List, the most
popular DNS records, on user devices, formed in a privacy-preserving manner
based on user interests. In this way, LLUAD can both improve privacy and reduce
access times to web content. The Popularity List is proactively retrieved from
a (curious) public server that continually updates and refreshes the records
based on user popularity votes, while efficiently broadcasting record
updates/changes to adhere to aggressive load-balancing schemes (i.e., name
servers actively load-balancing user connections by changing record IP
addresses). User votes are anonymized using a novel, efficient, and highly
scalable client-driven Voting Mix Network - with packet lengths independent of
the number of hops, centrally enforced limit on number of votes cast per user,
and robustness against poor client participation - to ensure a geographically
relevant and correctly/securely instantiated Popularity List.

Conclusion: 现代LLM驱动的代理需要全面的安全分析，安全考虑不足会导致严重漏洞，威胁用户系统的机密性和完整性。

Abstract: Coding agents, which are LLM-driven agents specialized in software
development, have become increasingly prevalent in modern programming
environments. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, which offer simple code
completion and suggestions, modern coding agents tackle more complex tasks with
greater autonomy, such as generating entire programs from natural language
instructions. To enable such capabilities, modern coding agents incorporate
extensive functionalities, which in turn raise significant concerns over their
security and privacy. Despite their growing adoption, systematic and in-depth
security analysis of these agents has largely been overlooked.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of eight
real-world coding agents. Our analysis addresses the limitations of prior
approaches, which were often fragmented and ad hoc, by systematically examining
the internal workflows of coding agents and identifying security threats across
their components. Through the analysis, we identify 15 security issues,
including previously overlooked or missed issues, that can be abused to
compromise the confidentiality and integrity of user systems. Furthermore, we
show that these security issues are not merely individual vulnerabilities, but
can collectively lead to end-to-end exploitations. By leveraging these security
issues, we successfully achieved arbitrary command execution in five agents and
global data exfiltration in four agents, all without any user interaction or
approval. Our findings highlight the need for a comprehensive security analysis
in modern LLM-driven agents and demonstrate how insufficient security
considerations can lead to severe vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化LLM推理具有安全性高、效率高和运营成本低的优势，但无许可环境缺乏对参与节点的先验信任，需要确保输出可验证性才能安全部署。

Method: 采用轻量级验证算法（验证成本仅为基础推理的约1%），结合同构推理-验证网络复用GPU资源，并通过同伴预测机制防止懒惰验证。

Result: 实现了在单一诚实验证者假设下的安全性，验证成本接近可忽略，提高了GPU利用率和端到端吞吐量，增强了系统鲁棒性和安全性。

Conclusion: VeriLLM是首个具有端到端博弈论安全证明的去中心化推理验证协议，诚实推理和验证构成了纳什均衡，确保了对抗理性对手的激励兼容性。

Abstract: Decentralized inference is an appealing paradigm for serving large language
models (LLMs), offering strong security, high efficiency, and lower operating
costs. Yet the permissionless setting admits no a priori trust in participating
nodes, making output verifiability a prerequisite for secure deployment. We
present VeriLLM, a publicly verifiable protocol for decentralized LLM inference
that (i) achieves security under a one-honest-verifier assumption, (ii) attains
near-negligible verification cost (about 1% of the underlying inference) via a
lightweight verification algorithm designed explicitly for LLMs, and (iii)
enforces honest checking through a peer-prediction mechanism that mitigates
lazy verification in naive voting. We further introduce an isomorphic
inference-verification network that multiplexes both roles on the same set of
GPU workers. This architecture (i) increases GPU utilization and thereby
improves end-to-end throughput for both inference and verification, (ii)
expands the effective pool of available validators, strengthening robustness
and security, and (iii) enforces task indistinguishability at the worker
boundary to prevent job-type-conditioned behavior. Finally, we provide a formal
game-theoretic analysis and prove that, under our incentives, honest inference
and verification constitute a Nash equilibrium, ensuring incentive
compatibility against rational adversaries. To our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized inference verification protocol with an end-to-end game-theoretic
security proof.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这是首个系统研究MCP服务器安全风险的研究，将MCP服务器视为主动威胁参与者，提出了基于组件的攻击分类法，开发了PoC攻击服务器，并发现现有检测方法不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP服务器使AI应用能够即插即用连接外部系统，但其快速扩散带来了严重安全风险。由于缺乏标准化审查机制，攻击者有机会分发恶意实现，而MCP服务器的安全影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将MCP服务器分解为核心组件，研究恶意开发者如何植入恶意意图。开发了概念验证服务器，在多样化真实主机-LLM环境中测试攻击有效性，并评估现有扫描器的检测能力。

Result: 提出了包含12个攻击类别的组件分类法，证明攻击者可以几乎零成本生成大量恶意服务器。测试发现现有检测方法不足，恶意MCP服务器易于实现、难以检测，并能对AI代理系统造成实际损害。

Conclusion: 应对这一威胁需要协议设计者、主机开发者、LLM提供商和终端用户的协调努力，以构建更安全、更有弹性的MCP生态系统。

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enable AI applications to connect to
external systems in a plug-and-play manner, but their rapid proliferation also
introduces severe security risks. Unlike mature software ecosystems with
rigorous vetting, MCP servers still lack standardized review mechanisms, giving
adversaries opportunities to distribute malicious implementations. Despite this
pressing risk, the security implications of MCP servers remain underexplored.
To address this gap, we present the first systematic study that treats MCP
servers as active threat actors and decomposes them into core components to
examine how adversarial developers can implant malicious intent. Specifically,
we investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious
MCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models
(LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP
server attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy
comprising twelve attack categories. For each category, we develop
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) servers and demonstrate their effectiveness across
diverse real-world host-LLM settings. We further show that attackers can
generate large numbers of malicious servers at virtually no cost. We then test
state-of-the-art scanners on the generated servers and found that existing
detection approaches are insufficient. These findings highlight that malicious
MCP servers are easy to implement, difficult to detect with current tools, and
capable of causing concrete damage to AI agent systems. Addressing this threat
requires coordinated efforts among protocol designers, host developers, LLM
providers, and end users to build a more secure and resilient MCP ecosystem.

TL;DR: FuncPoison是一种针对多智能体自动驾驶系统中函数库的投毒攻击方法，通过注入恶意工具来操纵智能体决策，引发级联错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体自动驾驶系统依赖共享函数库进行决策，但该组件作为安全漏洞未被充分研究。攻击者可以利用智能体基于文本指令选择工具的特性进行攻击。

Method: FuncPoison利用两个关键弱点：(1)智能体依赖文本指令选择工具；(2)工具使用标准化命令格式。通过注入带有欺骗性指令的恶意工具，操纵单个智能体决策并触发级联错误。

Result: 在两个代表性多智能体自动驾驶系统上的实验表明，FuncPoison能显著降低轨迹精度，灵活针对特定智能体诱导协调性错误行为，并能规避多种防御机制。

Conclusion: 函数库作为简单工具集的传统认知存在误导，它可能成为基于LLM的自动驾驶系统的关键攻击面，对其可靠性提出了更高关注。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on multi-agent architectures
powered by large language models (LLMs), where specialized agents collaborate
to perceive, reason, and plan. A key component of these systems is the shared
function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process
sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical
role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored
vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based
attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven
multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how
agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions
to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command
formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with
deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as
misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other
agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two
representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its
ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific
agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms.
Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple
toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving
systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了GSPR（通用安全策略推理器），通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）来识别不安全输入提示和违反安全分类法的LLM输出，能够跨多个安全基准进行训练并展示强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各种应用中的广泛集成，模型安全性成为关键问题。现有安全基准的分类法各不相同且策略分散，导致现有安全防护要么只能粗粒度区分安全与不安全，要么受限于单一基准的狭窄风险分类法。

Method: 使用组相对策略优化（GRPO）方法，通过精心设计的冷启动策略和奖励设计，激励模型在不同安全分类法下的推理能力，从而能够跨多个具有不同分类法的安全基准进行训练。

Result: 实验表明GSPR显著提升了现有安全护栏在安全和类别预测任务中的推理能力，不仅展示了强大的安全泛化能力，而且实现了最少的推理token成本并提供解释。

Conclusion: GSPR通过跨基准训练和GRPO方法，有效解决了现有安全防护的局限性，提供了更通用和细粒度的安全检测能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into numerous
applications across various domains, LLMs' safety becomes a critical concern
for both application developers and intended users. Currently, great efforts
have been made to develop safety benchmarks with fine-grained taxonomies.
However, these benchmarks' taxonomies are disparate with different safety
policies. Thus, existing safeguards trained on these benchmarks are either
coarse-grained to only distinguish between safe and unsafe, or constrained by
the narrow risk taxonomies of a single benchmark. To leverage these
fine-grained safety taxonomies across multiple safety benchmarks, in this
paper, we propose GSPR, a Generalizable Safety Policy Reasoner to identify
unsafe input prompts and LLMs' outputs with violated safety taxonomies through
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior safeguards which only
cover a fixed set of risk factors, our GSPR incentivizes its reasoning
capability with varied safety taxonomies through our careful cold-start
strategy and reward design. Consequently, our GSPR can be trained across
multiple safety benchmarks with distinct taxonomies and naturally exhibits
powerful generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to show that
our GSPR significantly improves existing safety guardrails' reasoning
capabilities for both safety and category prediction tasks. Moreover, our GSPR
not only demonstrates powerful safety generalization abilities but also
achieves the least inference token costs with explanations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估两种量子密钥分发网络架构的性能差异，特别关注交换QKD架构中模块不匹配对密钥生成率的影响，为网络设计提供指导。

Method: 首先实验评估商业DV-QKD模块性能，比较匹配和不匹配模块对的密钥生成率；然后进行理论分析，基于均匀环形网络推导最优密钥管理配置和可实现的密钥消耗率公式。

Result: 实验发现匹配与不匹配模块对之间存在显著的密钥生成率差异。理论分析表明交换QKD在密集环形网络（短距离、大节点数）中表现更好，而中继QKD在长距离大节点网络中更有效。

Conclusion: 网络架构选择需考虑网络拓扑和距离因素，不匹配QKD模块的惩罚会显著影响交换QKD架构的效率，在实际部署中需要权衡两种架构的优缺点。

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of two architectures for network-wide quantum key
distribution (QKD): Relayed QKD, which relays keys over multi-link QKD paths
for non-adjacent nodes, and Switched QKD, which uses optical switches to
dynamically connect arbitrary QKD modules to form direct QKD links between
them. An advantage of Switched QKD is that it distributes quantum keys
end-to-end, whereas Relayed relies on trusted nodes. However, Switched depends
on arbitrary matching of QKD modules. We first experimentally evaluate the
performance of commercial DV-QKD modules; for each of three vendors we
benchmark the performance in standard/matched module pairs and in unmatched
pairs to emulate configurations in the Switched QKD network architecture. The
analysis reveals that in some cases a notable variation in the generated secret
key rate (SKR) between the matched and unmatched pairs is observed. Driven by
these experimental findings, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis
that evaluates the network-wide performance of the two architectures. Our
analysis is based on uniform ring networks, where we derive optimal key
management configurations and analytical formulas for the achievable consumed
SKR. We compare network performance under varying ring sizes, QKD link losses,
QKD receivers' sensitivity and performance penalties of unmatched modules. Our
findings indicate that Switched QKD performs better in dense rings (short
distances, large node counts), while Relayed QKD is more effective in longer
distances and large node counts. Moreover, we confirm that unmatched QKD
modules penalties significantly impact the efficiency of Switched QKD
architecture.

TL;DR: BugMagnifier是一个针对TON区块链智能合约的漏洞检测框架，通过交易模拟和消息编排来系统性地发现异步执行漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TON区块链采用异步执行模型，智能合约面临由消息处理顺序不可预测性引起的竞态条件安全挑战，而现有的动态检测方法存在不足。

Method: 基于TON Sandbox和TVM构建的交易模拟框架，结合精确的消息队列操作、差分状态分析和概率性排列测试来检测异步执行缺陷。

Result: 实验评估显示BugMagnifier在专门构建的易受攻击合约上具有有效性，揭示了与消息比率相关的检测复杂性，符合理论预测。

Conclusion: BugMagnifier填补了TON安全工具的关键空白，为异步区块链环境中更安全的智能合约开发提供了实用支持，将漏洞发现从手动专家分析转向自动化证据生成。

Abstract: The Open Network (TON) blockchain employs an asynchronous execution model
that introduces unique security challenges for smart contracts, particularly
race conditions arising from unpredictable message processing order. While
previous work established vulnerability patterns through static analysis of
audit reports, dynamic detection of temporal dependencies through systematic
testing remains an open problem. We present BugMagnifier, a transaction
simulation framework that systematically reveals vulnerabilities in TON smart
contracts through controlled message orchestration. Built atop TON Sandbox and
integrated with the TON Virtual Machine (TVM), our tool combines precise
message queue manipulation with differential state analysis and probabilistic
permutation testing to detect asynchronous execution flaws. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates BugMagnifier's effectiveness through extensive
parametric studies on purpose-built vulnerable contracts, revealing message
ratio-dependent detection complexity that aligns with theoretical predictions.
This quantitative model enables predictive vulnerability assessment while
shifting discovery from manual expert analysis to automated evidence
generation. By providing reproducible test scenarios for temporal
vulnerabilities, BugMagnifier addresses a critical gap in the TON security
tooling, offering practical support for safer smart contract development in
asynchronous blockchain environments.

TL;DR: 量子计算机对现代公钥密码学构成威胁，本文从工程角度系统梳理了受量子威胁的技术，提供了跨领域、跨环境的威胁图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Shor和Grover等量子算法的发展，大规模量子计算机能够高效解决支撑RSA、Diffie-Hellman等广泛使用的密码原语的数学难题，一旦Shor算法实用化，这些密码原语将失效，威胁数字生态系统的安全。

Method: 从工程角度系统盘点受量子威胁的技术，按技术领域和实施环境进行组织，重点关注实际应用场景而非理论突破或协议级适应。

Result: 创建了跨领域、跨环境的威胁图谱，帮助从业者、供应商和政策制定者在密码相关量子计算机到来前识别暴露的技术。

Conclusion: 本文提供了实用的量子威胁地图，为量子安全过渡提供了工程指导，强调了在实际数字基础设施中识别量子脆弱系统的重要性。

Abstract: The emergence of large-scale quantum computers, powered by algorithms like
Shor's and Grover's, poses an existential threat to modern public-key
cryptography. This vulnerability stems from the ability of these machines to
efficiently solve the hard mathematical problems - such as integer
factorization and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem - that underpin
widely used cryptographic primitives. This includes RSA, Diffie-Hellman (DH),
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm (ECDSA), which are foundational to security across the digital
ecosystem. Once Shor's algorithm becomes practically realizable, these
primitives will fail, undermining both retrospective confidentiality and
cryptographic authenticity - enabling adversaries to decrypt previously
captured communications and forge digital signatures. This paper presents a
systematic inventory of technologies exposed to quantum threats from the
engineering perspective, organized by both technology domain and by
implementation environment. While prior research has emphasized theoretical
breaks or protocol-level adaptations, this work focuses on the practical
landscape - mapping quantum-vulnerable systems across diverse digital
infrastructures. The contribution is a cross-domain, cross-environment threat
map to guide practitioners, vendors, and policymakers in identifying exposed
technologies before the arrival of cryptographically relevant quantum
computers.

TL;DR: 提出了PRIVMARK框架，基于安全多方计算实现私有LLM水印，允许多方协作水印LLM输出而不暴露模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水印方法在敏感场景下存在隐私问题，需要直接访问模型参数或训练数据。

Method: 基于PostMark方法构建MPC协议，使用SecretFlow-SPU实现，采用ABY3后端。

Result: PRIVMARK在语义上与明文基线相同，对改写和移除攻击具有抵抗力，效率合理。

Conclusion: PRIVMARK为LLM水印提供了隐私保护的解决方案，解决了传统方法的隐私限制。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has highlighted the pressing
need for reliable mechanisms to verify content ownership and ensure
traceability. Watermarking offers a promising path forward, but it remains
limited by privacy concerns in sensitive scenarios, as traditional approaches
often require direct access to a model's parameters or its training data. In
this work, we propose a secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based private LLMs
watermarking framework, PRIVMARK, to address the concerns. Concretely, we
investigate PostMark (EMNLP'2024), one of the state-of-the-art LLMs
Watermarking methods, and formulate its basic operations. Then, we construct
efficient protocols for these operations using the MPC primitives in a
black-box manner. In this way, PRIVMARK enables multiple parties to
collaboratively watermark an LLM's output without exposing the model's weights
to any single computing party. We implement PRIVMARK using SecretFlow-SPU
(USENIX ATC'2023) and evaluate its performance using the ABY3 (CCS'2018)
backend. The experimental results show that PRIVMARK achieves semantically
identical results compared to the plaintext baseline without MPC and is
resistant against paraphrasing and removing attacks with reasonable efficiency.

Motivation: 击键动态是一种有前景的主动用户认证方式，但在LLM辅助输入和不同认知条件下的有效性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用50名用户的数据和布鲁姆分类法的认知标签，评估三种现实输入场景：真实写作、LLM内容改写和转录。采用连续性感知分割、特征提取以及SVM、MLP和XGB分类器。

Result: 系统在不同LLM使用和认知环境下保持可靠性能，等错误率在5.1%到10.4%之间。

Abstract: Keystroke dynamics is a promising modality for active user authentication,
but its effectiveness under varying LLM-assisted typing and cognitive
conditions remains understudied. Using data from 50 users and cognitive labels
from Bloom's Taxonomy, we evaluate keystroke-based authentication in Korean

Results show that the system maintains reliable performance across varying LLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI生成器产生的大规模图像需要能够嵌入高载荷水印的方法，以嵌入语义描述信息，便于后续检测图像是否经过语义修改。

Method: 基于传统水印方案，利用正交码和turbo码提高鲁棒性，集成频域嵌入和感知掩蔽技术增强水印不可感知性。

Result: 实验表明该方法对各种图像处理具有极强的鲁棒性，即使在传统和AI修复后也能检索嵌入文本，通过图像-文本不匹配分析揭示图像的语义修改。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在大规模AI生成图像中嵌入高载荷语义水印，并能有效检测图像是否经过语义修改。

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding,
where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the
input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to
robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by
modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional
watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved
robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking
techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the
proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing,
and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI
inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has
undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

*Tereza Burianová,Martin Perešíni,Ivan Homoliak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估PoS区块链中秘密单领导者选举机制的统一实验框架，发现在对抗性DoS攻击下，现有机制对领导者提供良好保护，但对验证者群体的协调攻击防御不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PoS区块链中的提议者匿名性面临DoS和审查攻击风险，现有SSLE机制的实际影响和权衡缺乏充分探索。

Method: 开发了基于以太坊PoS共识层的统一实验框架，包含可配置的对抗方，模拟Whisk和同态排序两种保护机制在多种攻击场景下的表现。

Result: 两种机制都能有效防御针对领导者的DoS攻击，但都无法有效防御验证者群体的协调攻击。Whisk通过缩小目标集简化了DoS攻击，而同态排序因计算复杂度高而不实用。

Conclusion: 现有SSLE机制在保护领导者方面表现良好，但对协调攻击防御不足，需要进一步研究更有效的保护方案。

Abstract: Proposer anonymity in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains is a critical concern
due to the risk of targeted attacks such as malicious denial-of-service (DoS)
and censorship attacks. While several Secret Single Leader Election (SSLE)
mechanisms have been proposed to address these threats, their practical impact
and trade-offs remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we present a
unified experimental framework for evaluating SSLE mechanisms under adversarial
conditions, grounded in a simplified yet representative model of Ethereum's PoS
consensus layer. The framework includes configurable adversaries capable of
launching targeted DoS and censorship attacks, including coordinated strategies
that simultaneously compromise groups of validators. We simulate and compare
key protection mechanisms - Whisk, and homomorphic sortition. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first comparative study to examine adversarial DoS
scenarios involving multiple attackers under diverse protection mechanisms. Our
results show that while both designs offer strong protection against targeted
DoS attacks on the leader, neither defends effectively against coordinated
attacks on validator groups. Moreover, Whisk simplifies a DoS attack by
narrowing the target set from all validators to a smaller list of known
candidates. Homomorphic sortition, despite its theoretical strength, remains
impractical due to the complexity of cryptographic operations over large
validator sets.

TL;DR: SecInfer是一种基于推理时扩展的新型防御方法，通过系统提示引导采样和目标任务引导聚合来有效缓解提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示注入攻击对大型语言模型构成普遍威胁，现有的基于微调的预防性防御方法对强攻击效果有限。

Method: SecInfer包含两个关键步骤：系统提示引导采样（通过不同系统提示探索多样推理路径生成多个响应）和目标任务引导聚合（选择最可能完成预期任务的响应）。

Result: 大量实验表明，SecInfer通过利用推理时的额外计算资源，有效缓解了现有和自适应的提示注入攻击，优于最先进的防御方法和现有的推理时扩展方法。

Conclusion: SecInfer作为一种基于推理时扩展的防御方法，在对抗提示注入攻击方面表现出色，为LLM安全提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a pervasive threat to the security of Large
Language Models (LLMs). State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically
rely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited
effectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \emph{SecInfer},
a novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \emph{inference-time
scaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more
compute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key
steps: \emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses
for a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of
system prompts, and \emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the
response most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments
show that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively
mitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling
approaches.

Conclusion: 通过协同设计方法，在降低隐私保护技术开销方面取得了进展，朝着实现LLM规模的隐私保护应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving technologies have introduced a paradigm shift that allows
for realizable secure computing in real-world systems. The significant barrier
to the practical adoption of these primitives is the computational and
communication overhead that is incurred when applied at scale. In this paper,
we present an overview of our efforts to bridge the gap between this overhead
and practicality for privacy-preserving learning systems using multi-party
computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE). Through meticulous hardware/software/algorithm co-design, we
show progress towards enabling LLM-scale applications in privacy-preserving
settings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in several contexts,
including DNN IP ownership, ethical LLM usage enforcement, and transformer
inference.

Motivation: 传统加密方法易受量子计算威胁，需要为资源受限的军事环境提供不依赖计算假设的可证明安全方案。

Method: 使用位级XOR操作构建二维秘密共享方案，复杂度为O(|S|)，提供信息论安全。

Result: 方案在每传输层单路径被观察和破坏时仍能保证消息恢复和完美隐私，具有无条件安全性。

Conclusion: 该XOR-based方案为资源受限环境提供了抗量子计算的可证明安全通信方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first two-dimensional XOR-based secret sharing
scheme for layered multipath communication networks. We present a construction
that guarantees successful message recovery and perfect privacy when an
adversary observes and disrupts any single path at each transmission layer. The
scheme achieves information-theoretic security using only bitwise XOR
operations with linear $O(|S|)$ complexity, where $|S|$ is the message length.
We provide mathematical proofs demonstrating that the scheme maintains
unconditional security regardless of computational resources available to
adversaries. Unlike encryption-based approaches vulnerable to quantum computing
advances, our construction offers provable security suitable for
resource-constrained military environments where computational assumptions may
fail.

Motivation: 当前视觉推理方法主要专注于探索特定推理模式，虽然在特定领域能取得改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 提出AdaVaR两阶段自适应视觉推理学习框架：在监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过精心设计的AdaGRPO算法的强化学习过程诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在赌博实验中表现出类似人类赌博成瘾的认知偏差和行为模式，包括控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和追逐损失等特征。模型自主性增强会加剧风险承担倾向，神经分析显示这些行为由抽象决策特征控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域的广泛应用，理解其是否存在类似人类病态决策模式具有实际意义，特别是在资产管理和商品交易等高风险场景中。

Method: 采用老虎机实验系统分析LLM决策，在认知行为层面识别赌博成瘾特征，通过稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析，并测试模型在自主设定目标和投注大小时的行为变化。

Result: 实验发现LLMs表现出控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和损失追逐等认知特征；模型自主性增强导致破产率显著上升和更多非理性行为；神经分析确认模型行为由风险和安全行为的抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化类似人类的认知偏差和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，这强调了在金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明LLM在形式化语言中解决的问题数量远少于通用LLM在自然语言中的表现，需要弥合非正式推理和形式验证之间的差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题分解为子目标，结合通用推理LLM和专用证明LLM，利用验证器反馈来修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比现有最佳方法高出6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题(70.0%)，相比SeedProver(50.4%)有显著提升。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式化证明生成之间的差距，证明了结合两种方法优势的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来判断发现何时能推广到其他模型，需要解决这一认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制对应轴（功能、发展、位置、关系、配置），并在Pythia模型系列中分析1-back注意力头的发育轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力在不同模型中的发展轨迹具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；更大模型的种子显示出更早出现、更陡峭增长和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的设计属性与其涌现行为和机制进行映射。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，通过几何交互确定正确性，替代全局排名，揭示主题专业化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估将多维能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其本质上的多维特性，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 提出JE-IRT框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享几何空间，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，正确性由模型与问题嵌入的几何交互决定。

Result: 实验表明：分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释；较大范数对应更难问题；新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入即可加入；学习空间揭示的LLM内部分类与人工定义类别仅部分一致。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备份助手扩展为长期教师，通过提炼问题解决策略来动态提升弱模型性能，显著减少对强模型的调用并节省成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，在面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵的强模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能在线学习并动态提升效率的方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为通用的可重用问题解决策略，这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态提升性能而无需微调。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和系统整体准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）并节省费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM间有效的上下文知识迁移，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用、可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Motivation: LLM展现出与人类相当的说服能力，既带来潜在益处也引发社会担忧，但系统评估其说服能力具有挑战性，因为人类说服效果在不同领域差异显著。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有人类-人类说服数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLM进行战略说服。

Result: 前沿模型能持续获得高说服收益，展现与理论预测一致的精妙说服策略；通过强化学习，即使是小模型也能显著提高说服收益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展的原则性框架来测量LLM的说服能力，证明LLM能够掌握复杂的说服策略，且通过训练可显著提升说服效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Result: 建立了成功检索此类公理的充分必要条件，并展示了在关键公理缺失时仍能解释开普勒第三定律等科学定律的能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理理论与数据不一致的情况，为自动化科学发现提供了新途径

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia游戏的信息不对称和心理理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，为评估LLMs的社会智能提供了有用的测试平台。

Method: 设计了四人简化版Mini-Mafia游戏，包含一个黑手党、一个侦探和两个村民。建立两阶段基准测试框架：首先在固定对手配置下估计胜率，然后使用标准化评分汇总跨配置表现。

Result: 实验揭示了反直觉的结果，包括较小模型在某些情况下优于较大模型。还量化了新兴的多智能体动态，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅用于基准测试，还支持对多智能体动态的定量研究，并为AI安全生成欺骗检测训练数据和跟踪模型欺骗能力提供了贡献。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出Agentless训练方法能够为SWE-Agent提供结构化技能先验，通过Kimi-Dev模型在SWE-bench上实现60.4%的验证通过率，并通过SFT适应使SWE-Agent达到48.6%的pass@1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件工程中的LLM应用存在SWE-Agent多轮交互和Agentless单轮验证两种范式，作者认为这两种范式并非互斥，Agentless训练能够为SWE-Agent提供有效的技能先验。

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方案并开发Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行SFT适应，将Agentless训练获得的技能先验转移到SWE-Agent框架中。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%通过率，是工作流方法中最佳表现；通过SFT适应后，SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet性能相当。

Conclusion: Agentless训练获得的结构化技能先验能够桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Motivation: LLM在不确定性决策任务中的应用日益增多，但其风险特征以及提示和校准方法的影响尚未充分探索，特别是后训练如何影响LLM的风险行为。

Method: 使用行为经济学和金融学工具，提出新的流程来引导和调节LLM的风险特征，比较预训练、指令微调和RLHF对齐的LLM，评估提示工程、上下文学习和后训练等调节策略。

Result: 指令微调模型表现出与标准效用模型一致的行为，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型偏离更多拟合的效用模型；后训练提供了最稳定有效的风险偏好调节。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同类型和阶段LLM的风险特征，展示了后训练如何调节这些特征，为行为对齐和风险感知的LLM设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统上大型语言模型在训练数据包含的任务和纯语言任务上表现最佳，这限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能够完成传统上被认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了认知心理学中经典心理意象任务的数十个新项目，首先测试多个最先进LLMs在纯文本指令下的表现，然后建立人类基线（100名被试），最后测试不同推理级别的模型性能。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著优于人类平均水平，当模型分配更多推理token时性能最强。这表明LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性的。

Conclusion: 研究不仅展示了LLMs在执行新任务时的涌现认知能力，还重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理（或至少非意象推理）可能足以完成长期以来被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖直接拼接图像和文本token，导致跨模态语义相关token之间的注意力距离过长，造成幻觉和性能下降

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，将语义相似的跨模态token分组，在相关视觉块附近插入文本token作为语义路标

Result: 在15个指标中的13个取得改进，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B等更大模型

Conclusion: Attention Anchor通过跨模态token联合分组有效改善了视觉语言模型的注意力机制，显著减少幻觉并提升性能

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex

tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA

Conclusion: SysMoBench有助于理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限，为该领域工具奠定坚实基础并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

### [108] [MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23143)
*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode是一种用于评估大语言模型数学推理能力的动态诊断方法，通过正弦驱动参数变化并分析模型输出的谐波响应，提供增益和相位等频率解析指标，比传统准确率更能揭示推理的动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法捕捉数学推理的动态特性和系统性偏差，需要一种能够量化模型在参数变化时推理一致性和保真度的诊断方法。

Method: 将参数化数学问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等Bode图式指标。

Result: 在五个闭式数学问题家族中，该方法揭示了传统准确率掩盖的系统性低通行为和增长的相位滞后，能够区分前沿模型和中端模型的动态性能。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一种紧凑、可复现的协议，补充了标准基准测试，能够对推理保真度和一致性进行可操作的测量，有助于进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

*Atma Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了热力学协调理论(TCT)，揭示了多智能体协调面临基本的热力学约束，协调协议需要显著的信息损失，导致系统出现持续的亚稳态和滞后现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调过程的基本约束，解释为什么协调需要信息损失，以及为什么系统会陷入亚稳态难以改变协调焦点。

Method: 使用信息论方法推导协调协议的最小描述长度，定义协调温度来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量和目标复杂度呈二次增长，协调需要渐进简化，系统会形成亚稳态直到环境剧变触发相变。

Conclusion: 协调本质上需要信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的无限循环和大型语言模型中的对齐伪装现象，为理解复杂系统的协调动力学提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi系统使用的二进制指数退避机制在密集部署中存在碰撞解决效率低下和公平性挑战的问题，无法满足新兴应用对可靠性的严格要求。

Method: 开发动态退避选择机制适应实时信道条件；提出基于EDCA原则的公平性量化指标；采用集中训练分散执行的CTDE架构，结合邻域活动模式作为观测输入，使用约束多智能体近端策略优化算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，与传统BEB相比显著降低碰撞概率，同时保持与商用Wi-Fi设备的向后兼容性，所提公平性指标有效消除了异构场景中的饥饿风险。

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架成功解决了密集Wi-Fi部署中的碰撞和公平性问题，为下一代无线网络提供了可行的信道接入优化方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Method: 提出基于Transformer的信息传播规则，使用符号推理任务进行理论分析，研究注意力层数与推理步骤之间的关系。

Result: 研究表明，对于具有L个注意力层的模型，在单次前向传播中，推理步骤的限制数量在O(3^{L-1})和O(2^{L-1})之间。

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic
mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to
theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps. We show that the limit number
of reasoning steps is between $O(3^{L-1})$ and $O(2^{L-1})$ for a model with
$L$ attention layers in a single-pass.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多令牌预测（MTP）范式如何帮助大型语言模型学习传递关系，这是复杂规划的关键。通过理论分析和实验验证，提出了两种改进策略来增强模型的路径规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多样任务中表现出色，但在学习传递关系（复杂规划的基础）方面仍有困难。为了解决这个问题，作者研究了MTP范式对传递关系学习的影响。

Method: 使用包含共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构进行理论分析。提出了两种改进策略：下一令牌注入（NTI）和基于Transformer的传递层。在合成图和Blocksworld规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 分析表明传递层逐渐学习多步邻接信息，使骨干模型能够捕获训练数据中未直接观察到的传递可达关系。改进策略显著增强了模型的路径规划能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对Transformer与MTP在复杂规划任务中学习机制的理解，提供了克服传递性瓶颈的实用策略，为构建结构感知的通用规划模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于学习的超参数配置方法存在样本复杂度高、泛化能力差的问题，需要一种无需训练、能够实时适应不同算法和问题的方法。

Method: 结合在线探索性景观分析(ELA)模块提供实时定量反馈，以及多LLM推理链来解释反馈并生成自适应超参数策略，将高层次推理与经验数据相结合。

Result: 在多种组合优化基准测试中，AutoEP持续优于最先进的调参器，包括神经进化和其他基于LLM的方法，开源模型Qwen3-30B能达到GPT-4的性能水平。

Conclusion: AutoEP展示了一种强大且易于使用的自动超参数设计新范式，能够有效利用LLM进行零样本算法控制。

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种无超参数的p-less采样方法，基于信息论动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务和温度配置影响，需要一种更稳健的采样策略。

Method: p-less采样：基于整个token概率分布的信息论方法，在每个解码步骤动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数。

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样优于现有方法，高温下文本质量下降更少，推理效率更高。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效且高效的无超参数采样方法，在各种任务中表现优异，特别适合高温生成场景。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)的设计空间，提出了混合数据合成框架和感知聚焦监督方法，在五个多模态基准测试中验证了VL-PRMs在提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号并限制跨任务泛化能力，因此需要探索更有效的VL-PRMs设计方法。

Method: 1) 提出混合数据合成框架，结合MCTS和强VLM的评判来生成更准确的步骤级标签；2) 引入感知聚焦监督，使PRM能明确检测视觉推理阶段的错误；3) 系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 实验发现：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现优于过程步骤选择；小型VL-PRMs在检测过程错误方面能匹配甚至超越大型模型；VL-PRMs能发掘更强VLM骨干的潜在推理能力；感知级监督显著提升测试时扩展性能；不同策略在高级数学推理数据集上均有改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为VL-PRMs的设计提供了系统指导，证明了其在提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性方面的潜力，有望推动VLM技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有GUI智能体在长任务中经常失败，标准过程奖励模型在处理GUI任务时存在'中间迷失'现象和缺乏UI变化感知的问题。

Method: 引入动态记忆机制（相关性检索模块和渐进式摘要模块）和自适应UI感知机制，使模型能智能处理历史上下文并感知UI状态变化。

Result: GUI-PRA能够更好地提供过程奖励，克服了标准PRM在GUI任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过结合动态记忆和UI变化感知，显著提升了GUI智能体在长任务中的表现。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提升了模型执行TIR任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵引导的采样和多阶段微调，有效解决了TIR中的效率问题，提升了模型推理的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

Conclusion: 模式感知方法对工具集成推理非常有效，显著提升了代码使用和准确性

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出JET方法，通过主动终止不必要的推理步骤来提升大型推理模型的效率，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务上表现出色，但深度推理会产生高昂计算成本。现有强化学习方法难以在推理过程中构建短路径，限制了学习效果。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤可能冗余。

Method: JET方法在推理过程中执行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径，并使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理同时保持正确性。

Result: 实验表明JET显著提高推理效率而不牺牲准确性。DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥赛基准上准确率提升4.6%，同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理，有效平衡了推理效率与准确性，为大型推理模型的实用部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.
Our code is available in the GitHub.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA是一个用于评估电子健康记录数据库代理的交互式基准测试，针对查询模糊性和术语不匹配问题，通过增量查询优化和自适应查询优化两种交互流程来测试代理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的代理在电子健康记录数据访问中应用有限，主要因为缺乏能够捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准测试，特别是处理查询模糊性和术语不匹配这两个核心挑战。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA基准测试，在模拟环境中使用LLM用户评估数据库代理的端到端工作流程，包括澄清用户问题、使用工具解决术语不匹配、生成正确SQL。采用增量查询优化和自适应查询优化两种交互流程。

Result: 实验显示，最先进的LLM在增量查询优化上Pass@5达到90-95%，自适应查询优化达到60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验均成功）显著降低35-60%，表明代理缺乏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在安全关键的电子健康记录领域，需要构建不仅性能好而且鲁棒性强的代理，论文提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解以指导未来代理开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Conclusion: ToolUniverse为构建AI科学家提供了必要的统一基础设施，解决了现有系统难以构建、缺乏共享环境的问题，促进了科学发现的协作。

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative
partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are
bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any
language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes
how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,
knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool
interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural
language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes
tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia,
ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of
a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的二进制代码相似性检测方法，通过结构化推理分析生成可解释的特征，解决了传统方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制代码相似性检测是逆向工程的核心任务，现有方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间存在权衡：手工特征可解释但泛化能力差，嵌入方法泛化能力强但不可解释且面临可扩展性-准确性权衡。

Method: 使用基于语言模型的智能体对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常数和算法意图等特征。这些特征既丰富又自适应，且可读可维护，可直接使用倒排或关系索引进行搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的recall@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP是一个新颖框架，利用预训练视觉语言模型从可视化TSP实例中识别有前景的小规模子问题，然后使用现成求解器高效优化，以改进全局解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要特定参数校准，而基于学习的方法因固定训练数据而泛化能力差、扩展性有限。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型从可视化TSP实例中识别有前景的小规模子问题，然后用现成求解器优化这些子问题来改进全局解。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP平均最优性差距低于0.2%，优于现有学习方法，在相同运行时间预算下比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3减少差距12%至100%。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个信息论框架GeoBS来评估AI模型中的地理偏见，该框架具有模型无关性、普适性和空间显式性，能够公平比较不同模型的geo-bias并分析空间因素贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型尤其是基础模型的广泛应用带来了严重的伦理问题，包括偏见问题。虽然已有研究关注社会偏见，但地理偏见研究较少且现有评估方法存在模型特定或空间隐式等局限性。

Method: 建立信息论框架GeoBS，提出三种考虑多尺度性、距离衰减和各向异性等复杂空间因素的新型geo-bias评分方法，并在3个任务、8个数据集和8个模型上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，无论是任务特定的GeoAI模型还是通用基础模型都可能存在各种类型的地理偏见，验证了所提框架的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅推进了对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Method: 基于项目反应理论的概率建模框架，引入主题级技能配置文件的协同过滤模型，以及新的离散变分推理框架来处理低数据场景。

Result: 在数学正式考试预测中达到超过80%的准确率，在低数据设置下表现优于所有经典IRT和矩阵分解基线方法，发现单一潜在能力参数足以实现最大预测准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的离散变分推理框架在低数据环境下表现最佳，为构建有效的AI辅导系统提供了重要技术基础，有助于缩小教育不平等差距。

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

*Siyang Wu,Honglin Bao,Sida Li,Ari Holtzman,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了容量熟悉度签名来表征大语言模型基准测试及其有意义的重叠。基准签名通过从真实语料中提取的关键词集来探测基准性能所需的模型能力，这些关键词的困惑度能高度预测模型在基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力有限以及主流基准一致性研究固有缺陷等问题，需要一种更稳健的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和模型能力的内在联系。

Method: 通过大规模元评估，使用逐步前向选择和线性回归方法，在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，涵盖知识、编码、逻辑、指令遵循、数学、语言、推理和世界建模等多个领域。

Result: 发现知识和推理子任务存在重叠，而多语言和文化基准相似度较低。性能结果受基准正交因素（如问题格式）强烈影响，但基准签名对这些影响保持稳健。编码领域与其他领域重叠最少。

Conclusion: 基准签名为基准有效性和LLM敏感性提供了机制性洞察，描绘了相互关联的LLM能力底层图景，有助于更准确地评估模型真实能力。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发更可信的AI系统提供了实践指导，特别是在疾病诊断和刑事司法等关键领域。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

Motivation: 随着低代码和模板化智能体开发平台的兴起，平台编排的智能体系统被广泛部署用于复杂推理任务，但这些系统脆弱且缺乏系统性的故障根因识别方法。

Method: 构建AgentFail数据集（包含307个故障日志），利用反事实推理修复策略确保标注可靠性，开发故障根因分类法，并建立基于LLM的自动根因识别基准测试。

Result: 分类法能显著提升根因识别性能，但最佳准确率仅为33.6%，表明该任务仍具挑战性。研究还提供了构建可靠智能体系统的实用指南。

Conclusion: 本文为平台编排的智能体系统提供了可靠的故障根因数据集、分类法和基准测试，为开发更可靠的智能体系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM自身判断来评估模型性能的廉价方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新LLM不断发布，但参数数量不能准确反映性能，需要独立评估方法。传统Elo评分需要人类比较输出，成本高昂。

Method: 使用LLM自身来评判模型对决，通过统计LLM一致选择某个模型为最佳的比例来生成评估指标。

Result: LLM自身判断产生的指标与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的高度相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人类数据或先验知识的廉价Elo分数代理指标。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向自主、智能方向快速发展，其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为带来了重大风险，传统验证方法已不再适用，需要转向概率保证方法。

Method: AgentGuard作为检查层，观察智能体的原始I/O并将其抽象为状态模型转换的形式化事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）来形式化建模智能体的涌现行为，并通过概率模型检查实时验证量化属性。

Result: 该框架能够为智能AI系统提供运行时验证和概率保证。

Conclusion: AgentGuard通过动态概率保证的新范式，为智能AI系统的安全验证提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Motivation: 研究多智能体编排是否能通过集体决策超越单个LLM的性能，并探索影响编排效果的因素如作者身份可见性和投票过程透明度。

Method: 使用四个LLM在三个基准测试上进行实验：比较编排与单模型基线性能，并在GPQA-Diamond上进行消融实验，控制作者身份可见性和投票过程可见性。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越最强单模型，始终优于其他模型。隐藏作者身份减少自投票和平局，隐藏投票过程减少从众效应。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，通过控制信息透明度可以优化集体决策过程，避免偏见并提升共识质量。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PASS框架，使用强化学习将初始越狱提示转化为形式化描述，增强隐蔽性并绕过现有对齐防御，然后将越狱输出构建为GraphRAG系统以强化后续攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力出众，但也带来了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击可能使模型偏离人类价值观，需要发现对齐方法中的漏洞。

Method: 采用强化学习将初始越狱提示转化为形式化描述，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入来强化攻击。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，增强越狱攻击的隐蔽性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Motivation: 为了解决直接处理XML在BPMN图表创建和编辑中的局限性，开发一个更可靠、更高效的工具来提升自然语言到BPMN的转换质量。

Method: 引入专门的JSON表示法作为结构化替代方案，使用图编辑距离(GED)和相对图编辑距离(RGED)评估生成质量，使用二元成功指标评估编辑性能。

greater reliability, faster processing, and significantly higher editing
success rates. We discuss key trade-offs, limitations, and future improvements.

*ChaoBo Zhang,Long Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出TCM-HEDPR模型，通过知识图谱扩散引导的中医处方个性化推荐方法，解决患者个性化信息不足、草药数据长尾分布和草药配伍关系忽略等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中医处方推荐模型存在三个主要问题：(1)忽略患者个性化信息如年龄、BMI、病史等，影响证候识别准确性；(2)草药数据的长尾分布导致训练偏差；(3)忽视"君臣佐使"配伍原则，增加毒副作用风险。

Method: 采用分层结构增强的个性化推荐方法：预训练症状表示使用患者个性化提示序列；应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；使用知识图谱引导的同构图扩散方法结合自注意力机制；设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验验证了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行全面评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更准确地识别证候、缓解长尾数据问题，并遵循中医配伍原则。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

TL;DR: 本文对V2X协同感知系统进行了实证研究，识别了6种常见错误模式，评估了关键组件的影响，发现LiDAR协同配置性能最佳，V2I和V2V在不同融合方案下表现不同，协同感知错误会增加驾驶违规频率，且系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V2X协同感知系统虽然能解决单智能体感知的远距离物体检测和遮挡问题，但由于其复杂的组成（多样传感器类型、协同智能体、不同融合方案和通信条件），带来了许多操作挑战。当系统产生错误预测时，错误类型和根本原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，系统评估V2X协同感知系统的关键组件，识别和分析6种常见错误模式，评估不同配置对感知性能的影响。

Result: 发现：(1) LiDAR协同配置感知性能最高；(2) V2I和V2V通信在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3) 协同感知错误增加会导致更高频率的驾驶违规；(4) 协同感知系统在在线运行时对通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，希望研究结果能促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈在LLM对齐中至关重要，但反馈往往存在噪声或不一致，这会降低奖励模型质量并阻碍对齐效果。虽然已有多种自动数据清洗方法，但缺乏对其有效性和泛化性的系统评估。

Method: 引入PrefCleanBench基准，提供标准化协议来评估清洗策略在对齐性能和泛化性方面的表现，涵盖多样化数据集、模型架构和优化算法。

Result: 通过统一和严格比较不同方法，揭示了决定数据清洗在LLM对齐任务中成功的关键因素。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过改善数据质量来提升LLM对齐效果提供了原则性和可复现的方法，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的关键但未被充分探索的作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

TL;DR: BridgeDrive是一种新颖的锚点引导扩散桥策略，用于闭环轨迹规划，在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有方法提高了5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散规划器在自动驾驶中显示出巨大潜力，但在反应式闭环环境中有效引导这些模型仍面临挑战。简单的条件化在复杂动态驾驶场景中往往无法提供足够指导，而现有方法依赖截断调度会引入理论不一致性并影响性能。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive方法，采用锚点引导的扩散桥策略，提供原则性的扩散框架，将锚点有效转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适当响应变化的交通条件。该方法兼容高效的ODE求解器，适合实时自动驾驶部署。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有方法提高了5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了一个有效的锚点引导扩散框架，在复杂动态驾驶场景中表现出色，且具备实时部署的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

TL;DR: PSG-Agent是一个个性化和动态的LLM智能体安全防护系统，通过挖掘用户交互历史创建个性化防护策略，并实施跨轮次连续监控来应对累积风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护系统存在两个根本限制：(i)对所有用户应用统一防护策略，忽略了相同行为对不同用户的风险差异；(ii)孤立检查每个响应，未能捕捉跨多轮交互的风险演变和累积。

Method: 首先通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态创建个性化防护；其次在智能体流水线中实施连续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护、内存守护等专门防护组件，跟踪跨轮次风险累积并发出可验证裁决。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于现有智能体防护系统（包括LlamaGuard3和AGrail）。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM智能体提供了可执行和可审计的个性化安全路径。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Result: 在多个挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具有推理能力而非仅能流畅模仿的小型模型提供了可行路径

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR从黑盒优化重新定义为可预测的结构自组织过程，为未来AI系统推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary

of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in

### [148] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征具有较差的敏感性，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SAE特征主要通过激活示例来表征，但这些示例无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上的可靠激活程度。

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活。

Result: 敏感性衡量了特征质量的新维度，许多可解释特征具有较差的敏感性。人类评估证实当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对GPT-OSS-20B模型进行安全评估，发现多种对抗条件下的失败模式，包括量化热、推理黑洞、薛定谔合规性等，这些行为可被利用导致严重后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-OSS系列开源语言模型在对抗条件下的安全性和鲁棒性，特别是其显式思维链推理和Harmony提示格式的安全性。

Method: 使用Jailbreak Oracle（JO）系统化LLM评估工具，对GPT-OSS-20B模型在不同对抗条件下进行安全测试。

Result: 发现了多种失败模式：量化热、推理黑洞、薛定谔合规性、推理过程幻象和链式导向提示，这些行为可被恶意利用。

Conclusion: GPT-OSS-20B模型在对抗条件下存在严重安全漏洞，其显式思维链推理机制可能被利用来绕过安全防护。

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an
extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior
under different adversarial conditions. Using the Jailbreak Oracle (JO) [1], a
systematic LLM evaluation tool, the study uncovers several failure modes
including quant fever, reasoning blackholes, Schrodinger's compliance,
reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting. Experiments
demonstrate how these behaviors can be exploited on GPT-OSS-20B models, leading
to severe consequences.

*Siqi Ma,Jiajie Huang,Bolin Yang,Fan Zhang,Jinlin Wu,Yue Shen,Guohui Fan,Zhu Zhang,Zelin Zang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedLA框架，这是一个基于逻辑驱动的多智能体系统，通过构建显式逻辑树和多方讨论来解决复杂医疗问题，在医疗诊断和问答任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度的逻辑不一致问题，需要更透明的推理过程。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提、结论）构建显式逻辑树，通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代优化逻辑树，实现错误纠正和矛盾解决。

Result: MedLA在MedDDx和标准医疗QA基准测试中持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线，在开源和商业LLM骨干网络上都能有效扩展，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedLA提供了一个可推广的、值得信赖的医疗推理范式，通过逻辑驱动的多智能体协作实现透明推理和前提级对齐。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EAPO框架，通过多轮外部专家交互增强LLM在强化学习中的探索能力，提高推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结果监督的RL方法存在探索效率低和奖励稀疏问题，需要改进LLM推理训练方式

Method: EAPO框架让策略模型自适应决定何时及如何咨询外部专家，通过专家交互获得更丰富的奖励信号和可靠推理轨迹

Result: 在AIME 2024、AIME 2025和AIMO 2025数学推理基准上，EAPO平均比自探索模型提升5分，优于专家辅助工作流和专家蒸馏模型

Conclusion: 外部专家协助能够将专家知识内化到策略模型中，增强模型固有推理能力，优化后的模型能独立产生更好的推理路径和更准确的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd是一个过程奖励模型，通过提供密集的逐步反馈来解决GUI任务中稀疏奖励和信用分配问题，在在线和离线任务中都显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列GUI任务中的自主智能体面临稀疏奖励和难以处理的信用分配问题，这阻碍了智能体的有效学习。

Method: 开发GUI-Shepherd过程奖励模型，基于包含52k交互的大规模数据集进行训练，该数据集包含人工标注分数和GPT-4o生成的推理过程，可作为RL训练中的奖励提供者和推理过程中的验证器。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，通过多轮在线PPO将成功率提高了7.7个百分点；作为推理验证器带来5.1个百分点的改进；在AndroidControl基准测试中分别获得2.2和4.3个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 高质量的过程监督对于构建更强大的GUI智能体至关重要，GUI-Shepherd提供了一个通用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Conclusion: OCEAN框架在保持竞争性能的同时，提供了忠实且可解释的决策过程，显著提升了用户对AI解释的信任度。

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemMAS是一个基于多智能体系统的化学反应条件推荐框架，通过证据推理和可解释的决策过程来预测反应条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型方法很少解释推荐反应条件的原理，这限制了它们在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 将条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，分解为机理基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和原理聚合四个步骤。

Result: 在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提高20-35%，比通用大语言模型提高10-15%，并提供可证伪、可信赖的推理依据。

Conclusion: 为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过多智能体系统提供基于化学知识和检索先例的决策依据。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Method: 构建包含57,515个VQA对的大型视觉语言安全数据集Falcon，涵盖13种危害类别；并基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B微调开发了专门的评估器FalconEye。

Result: FalconEye在复杂多模态对话场景中可靠识别有害内容，在Falcon-test数据集及VLGuard、Beavertail-V基准测试中总体准确率优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FalconEye可作为MLLMs实用的安全审计工具，填补了多模态内容安全评估的空白。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 基于结果的奖励本身不会强化错误动作，但梯度耦合是智能体强化学习中的关键问题，通过动作分类训练可以有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

TL;DR: 提出了CANON方法，通过无方向性的优势估计来增强目标指标的影响，在数学推理和复杂逻辑任务中优于现有方法，同时提高令牌效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在LLM推理任务中依赖手工设计的奖励或优势塑造，这些方向性先验可能过于偏颇且需要仔细的超参数调整，容易导致失败。

Method: CANON方法基于目标指标将采样响应分为高低两组，通过组间比较测量哪个指标趋势能带来更好性能，并在同组内识别更好的响应，不预设指标方向。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于先前方法；应用于响应长度时进一步提高了令牌效率，在性能-成本权衡中产生更优的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: CANON提供了一种无需预设指标方向的有效优势估计方法，在提升LLM推理能力的同时优化了令牌效率，为RLVR训练提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Result: 实验证明该方法能够生成准确的分类器，同时保持可解释性，并支持传统方法未考虑的可配置信息源。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保持可解释性的前提下，利用多种信息源自动筛选科学文献，为系统文献综述提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

TL;DR: TusoAI是一个基于大语言模型的智能AI系统，能够根据科学任务描述和评估函数自主开发和优化计算方法，在多个科学领域超越现有专家方法和AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学发现常因手动开发计算工具而缓慢，现有LLM系统要么专注于使用现有方法进行科学分析，要么开发通用机器学习方法，未能有效整合特定科学领域的非结构化知识。

Method: TusoAI将领域知识整合到知识树表示中，执行迭代的领域特定优化和模型诊断，通过候选解决方案池改进性能。

Result: 在单细胞RNA-seq数据去噪和卫星地球监测等多样化任务中，TusoAI超越了最先进的专家方法、MLE代理和科学AI代理。应用于遗传学两个关键开放问题，改进了现有计算方法并发现了新的生物学知识。

Conclusion: TusoAI展示了自主开发科学计算方法的潜力，能够加速科学发现并揭示新的生物学关联。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Alistair-Turcan/TusoAI.

Motivation: 传统基于规则或小模型的数据分析方法存在局限性，而基于LLM和智能代理的技术能够实现复杂数据理解、自然语言界面、语义分析功能和自主管道编排，在学术界和工业界产生了重大影响。

Method: 从模态视角系统回顾LLM在数据分析中的应用：结构化数据（如表问答、NL2GQL）、半结构化数据（如标记语言理解）、非结构化数据（如图表理解、文档理解）和异构数据（如数据检索、模态对齐）。

Conclusion: LLM/Agent作为数据分析师具有巨大潜力，但仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究以推进该领域发展，包括改进语义理解、多模态集成和自主决策能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，需要至少2次重复运行来获得稳定的模型排名结果。研究发现83%的切片在单次运行中会出现排名反转，而两次运行可以消除约83%的此类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能获得可靠结论尚不明确。本文旨在评估额外重复运行的价值，为实践者提供成本感知的指导。

Method: 在AI4Math基准上重新评估八个最先进模型，每个设置进行三次独立运行。使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估方法。

Result: 单次运行排行榜很脆弱：83%的切片相对于三次运行多数结果至少出现一次成对排名反转。两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转问题。平均运行次数可获得适度的标准误差缩减（约5%从一次到三次）。

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行。这些实践在保持小团队可行性的同时提高了鲁棒性，有助于使模型比较与现实世界可靠性保持一致。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Motivation: 工具集成推理已成为实现智能代理应用的关键焦点，DeepResearch代理因其在复杂开放信息搜索任务中的强大表现而备受关注。

Conclusion: Fathom-DeepResearch系统通过专门化的搜索和合成模型，结合创新的训练方法，在复杂信息搜索任务中实现了可靠的高性能，能够支持超过20次工具调用的扩展推理过程。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险数据敏感领域部署AI代理提供了可靠解决方案，实现了透明决策和系统可靠性保障。

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但其最终答案经常与自身推理过程相矛盾，这揭示了当前推理微调范式的关键局限性。

Method: 通过控制实验测试误导性线索对推理的影响和损坏答案对检索的影响，并开发了FARL框架，结合记忆遗忘和强化学习来抑制检索捷径。

Result: 实验证实推理和记忆检索机制同时存在，其相对主导地位受问题领域、模型规模和微调方法影响。FARL框架能有效促进推理主导行为。

Conclusion: 当前推理微调范式存在模型利用检索机制作为捷径的问题，FARL框架通过抑制这种捷径，增强了模型的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RPO（鲁棒偏好优化）框架，通过EM算法处理人类偏好数据中的噪声和异质性问题，将现有对齐算法转化为鲁棒版本，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好对齐方法（如RLHF）基于错误假设：人类偏好是同质的且数据无噪声。实际上人类偏好是多元的，标注者会犯错，导致数据与真实偏好存在差异，影响模型性能。

Method: 使用期望最大化（EM）算法推断每个标签的正确性后验概率，自适应地重新加权训练损失中的数据点以减轻噪声。建立偏好损失与概率模型的理论联系，将现有对齐算法系统转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架，显著提升了四种先进对齐算法（DPO、IPO、SimPO、CPO）的性能。在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强的方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别获得最高7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO提供了一个通用的鲁棒偏好对齐框架，理论上证明在完美校准模型条件下能收敛到数据集的真实噪声水平，实验证明能有效提升现有对齐算法的性能。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

Motivation: 探索为什么在线对齐方法（如GRPO）通常比离线对齐方法（如DPO）表现更好，从人类感知角度提供理论解释。

Method: 基于前景理论分析人类概率感知偏差，提出humanline设计模式，将人类概率感知失真显式融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中。

Result: humanline变体即使使用离线非策略数据训练，也能在可验证和不可验证任务上达到与在线方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法对人类效用最大化并非本质，通过模拟人类感知失真可以实现更快速、廉价和灵活的后训练而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡：声明式方法缺乏动态环境适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且难以扩展

Method: 提出动作链作为基本规划单元，采用循环流程：构建意图绑定的动作序列、主动验证冲突和可行性、针对性机制修复问题、执行验证动作

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中达到可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token

Conclusion: ELHPlan为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票在所有输入上使用统一的推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题思考不足，需要实例自适应的推理计算分配。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的引导向量来决策停止或进行小步推理，采用GRPO作为奖励信号自适应调节推理深度，结合课程学习和奖励工程。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-精度边界，以更低的FLOPs获得匹配的精度，优于早期退出基线方法。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder成功实现了实例自适应的推理计算分配，学习到的计算分配与问题难度相关，无需修改主干网络权重即可提升推理效率。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 该论文发现了语言模型融合的实证缩放定律，提出了一个紧凑的幂律关系，能够预测模型大小和专家数量对交叉熵损失的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏定量规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大时的收益回报。

Method: 通过实证研究识别出连接模型大小和专家数量的幂律关系，并基于此提出了一个简单理论来解释收益随专家数量增加而下降的规律。

Result: 该定律在领域内和跨领域都成立，紧密拟合了不同架构和方法下的测量曲线，并解释了收益早期获得和变异性随专家增加而缩小的规律。

Conclusion: 该缩放定律使模型融合从启发式实践转变为可计算效率、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供了可预测的增益路径。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要长输出和高延迟，限制实际部署。现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入检测开销，限制延迟收益和泛化能力。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，避免探测开销。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟提升2.5倍，准确率不受影响。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态可为高效推理提供有效提前退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中有更广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作任务中系统需要推断用户对队友意图假设的复杂性，需要可解释和可纠正的表示，使用户能够检查和改进系统行为。

Method: 将协作任务学习构建为程序合成问题，使用可编辑程序表示行为，通过叙述演示（物理动作+自然语言）作为统一的教学、检查和纠正模式。

Result: 在20名用户的多玩家足球战术教学研究中，70%参与者成功精炼学习程序以匹配其意图，90%认为纠正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将学习表示为程序以及在协作物理活动中支持用户教学的独特挑战，并讨论了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出现有图推理方法和基准测试存在问题，发现基础模型因推理焦点不当而被低估。通过将推理焦点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，基础模型能轻松解决现有基准中的大多数图推理任务。作者构建了更具挑战性的GraphAlgorithm基准，并提出了Simple-RTC方法，在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率，在新基准上显著优于所有先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在图推理任务中表现不佳，作者认为这是由于方法和基准测试存在问题。基础模型的能力被低估，需要重新思考LLMs在图推理中的发展方向。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法：引导LLMs首先设计图算法，然后编写代码来解决图推理任务。构建了包含239个不同图问题和3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过重新定向推理焦点，基础模型能够有效解决图推理任务。Simple-RTC为LLMs图推理提供了强大的基线，鼓励该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

TL;DR: 提出风险敏感强化学习框架RS-GRPO，通过风险寻求目标在均值与最大奖励间插值，解决RLVR方法在LLMs推理任务中的探索困境，提升多解性能(pass@k)同时保持单解精度(pass@1)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLMs的尖锐初始策略将标准RL算法限制在狭窄解空间中，虽然提升了单解准确率(pass@1)，但抑制了解多样性和多解性能(pass@k)，导致RLVR更多是蒸馏现有能力而非发现新推理策略。

Method: 引入风险敏感强化学习框架，采用风险寻求目标在均值与最大奖励间插值，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从挑战性提示中学习来驱动深度探索。该方法实现简单，仅需少量代码修改。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试和五种不同LLMs上，RS-GRPO持续改进pass@k性能，同时维持或提升pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO有效解决了RLVR的探索困境，能够在保持单解精度的同时显著提升多解性能，为LLMs在复杂推理任务中的能力提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统移动消息设计由于无法探索高维设计空间而存在显著局限性，需要开发更有效的方法来优化医疗沟通。

Method: 基于DIKW层次结构构建的智能代理系统，通过专门的计算代理逐步将原始实验数据转化为可操作的消息设计策略，支持并行处理、假设验证和持续学习。

Result: 在两阶段实验中（第一阶段444,691次患者接触，第二阶段74,908次），最佳生成消息的参与率达到68.76%，相比61.27%的基线提升了12.2%的相对点击率。

Conclusion: PAME-AI的智能代理架构特别适合大规模医疗沟通优化，能够有效提升患者消息的参与度和效果。

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

TL;DR: AdvChain：一种通过对抗性思维链调优来增强大型推理模型安全性的对齐方法，能够动态自我纠正推理过程中的偏差，解决有害合规和过度拒绝的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全思维链调优方法存在"滚雪球效应"问题，即推理过程中的微小偏差会逐步放大，导致模型要么有害合规，要么过度拒绝。这源于模型被训练模仿完美推理脚本而缺乏自我纠正能力。

Method: 提出AdvChain对齐范式，构建包含诱惑-纠正和犹豫-纠正样本的数据集，通过对抗性思维链调优教导模型从有害推理漂移和不必要谨慎中恢复。

Result: 实验表明AdvChain显著增强了对越狱攻击和思维链劫持的鲁棒性，同时大幅减少了良性提示上的过度拒绝，在不损害推理能力的情况下实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向，通过动态自我纠正机制解决了思维链推理中的安全挑战。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

TL;DR: G-reasoner是一个统一框架，通过集成图与语言基础模型，在多样化图结构知识上进行推理。它使用QuadGraph标准化抽象层统一异构知识源，并引入3400万参数的图基础模型(GFM)来联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，与LLMs集成增强下游应用的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，因为信息碎片化且知识结构建模薄弱。图结构能自然建模知识关系，但LLMs无法有效在图结构数据上推理。现有的图增强RAG方法依赖临时图设计、启发式搜索或昂贵的代理管道，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出G-reasoner框架，核心是QuadGraph四层抽象标准化异构知识源。引入3400万参数的图基础模型(GFM)联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，与LLMs集成。采用混合精度训练和分布式消息传递实现可扩展性。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，G-reasoner持续优于最先进的基线方法，显著增强了LLM推理能力，并实现了强大的效率和跨图泛化能力。

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一图与语言基础模型，有效解决了现有RAG方法在图结构知识推理中的局限性，提供了可扩展、高效的解决方案，并在多个基准测试中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Result: SCI-Verifier展现出强大的逻辑推理和等价判断能力，同时保持简洁稳定的输出

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，通过系统评估和实用路径来增强LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Motivation: 现有MLLM在医疗诊断中存在早期证据解释不稳定的关键失败模式，导致推理轨迹分支并产生全局不一致结论，需要约束随机性和幻觉的可审计临床推理系统。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过多样化短轨迹稳定推理，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并使用联合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在临床决策支持等高风险领域部署可信AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

Motivation: 解决FinTech领域LLMs微调时产生不专业或轻率回复的问题，以及领域特定数据集稀缺导致的研究局限。

Method: 构建Fin-Vault数据集（1,417个标注多轮对话），开发Fin-Ally模型集成常识推理、礼貌性和对话动态，使用COMET-BART嵌入常识上下文并通过DPO优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为FinTech领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，能够生成更专业和可信的金融建议。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，并在自动数据生成过程中进行大规模搜索空间导航，导致效率低下且不灵活。需要更高效、自适应的数据生成方法来提升过程奖励模型的训练质量。

Method: AMCS框架将数据生成从固定静态搜索转变为自适应动态搜索：1）自适应节点值估计，为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本；2）基于蒙特卡洛算法的时间自适应路径扩展策略，从广泛探索逐渐转向最有希望方向的利用。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，优于所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下超越了72B模型。在分布外问题上也保持优势，显示出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AMCS通过自适应搜索策略显著提升了过程奖励模型的数据生成效率和质量，为复杂数学推理任务提供了有效的解决方案，并展现出良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

### [188] [Plan before Solving: Problem-Aware Strategy Routing for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24377)
*Shihao Qi,Jie Ma,Ziang Yin,Lingling Zhang,Jian Zhang,Jun Liu,Feng Tian,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM是一个新颖的数学推理框架，通过策略规划和目标执行两阶段方法，自适应地选择最优推理策略，在多个数学推理基准测试中显著优于单一策略和集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，但单一策略无法适应问题特定需求，且在效果和效率之间缺乏权衡。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，首先构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，然后训练轻量级策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布，在推理时通过自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM相比单一策略和集成基线实现了0.9%到7.6%的性能提升，自适应路由方法在不同模型架构上都表现出强大优势。

Conclusion: PRISM通过自适应策略选择有效解决了数学推理中效果与效率的权衡问题，为LLM的数学推理能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程来增强大型推理模型的安全性，将合规步骤替换为安全触发机制，在保持推理性能的同时显著降低有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这些不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用。现有方法忽视了安全推理的重要性，影响了模型的可信度。

Method: 提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，基于三个关键发现：安全推理由关键安全触发步骤巩固；合规线索与不安全延续强相关；纠正干预能可靠地将不安全轨迹转向安全路径。IPO通过替换合规步骤为安全触发，构建强信号偏好学习对。

Result: 在越狱和对抗性安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升了推理和响应的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线方法，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在多样化推理任务中保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ContextPRM方法，通过建模领域无关的逻辑流程而非验证领域知识，提升过程奖励模型在非数学领域的泛化能力，在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域平均准确率提升6.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现良好，但由于缺乏领域特定训练数据和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域泛化能力有限。

Method: 将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流程，关注思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性，采用新的数据标注和训练框架。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）通过加权多数投票实现6.5%平均准确率提升，显著优于VersaPRM的2.2%提升和其他数学导向PRM的0.5%增益。

Conclusion: 该方法在数学和非数学领域均表现一致，验证了基于上下文连贯性的过程奖励模型具有更好的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合约束获取框架，通过结合被动学习和主动查询来减少过拟合，在数据有限的情况下实现高模型覆盖率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决约束编程中手动建模的瓶颈问题，传统被动约束获取方法容易过拟合，而纯主动方法查询成本高，需要一种平衡方案。

Method: 集成被动学习生成候选约束，基于概率置信度的交互式精炼阶段识别过拟合约束，专门的子集探索机制从被拒绝候选中恢复有效子结构，最后进行主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，同时保持可管理的查询复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多任务需求预测的动态人工神经网络方法NMT-Net，通过训练期间的计算图结构适应性，实现类似生物神经可塑性的动态网络调整。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法主要关注推理时动态性或计算效率，而本方法受生物系统中神经可塑性的启发，旨在实现训练期间网络结构的动态适应性。

Method: 每个新任务触发动态网络适应，包括基于相似性的任务识别和候选ANN头部的选择性训练，然后根据性能评估并集成到模型中。

Result: 在三个真实世界多任务需求预测数据集上评估，相比传统基线和最先进的多任务学习方法，实现了更低的RMSE和标准差。

Conclusion: NMT-Net为时间序列预测中的多任务和持续学习提供了可扩展、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub
repository.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EvoPH框架，结合岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，通过共同演化提示和启发式算法来优化组合优化问题，在TSP和BPP问题上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统组合优化问题依赖手工设计的启发式算法，需要大量领域知识和实现工作。现有LLM方法容易陷入局部最优，需要更好的演化策略。

Method: EvoPH框架整合岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，共同演化提示和启发式算法，通过性能反馈指导进化过程。

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH相比最优解实现了最低的相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推动了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域的发展，通过协同演化策略有效避免了局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Motivation: 解决先前世界模型无法准确预测复杂环境中物体交互的问题，为实际应用如机器人学提供安全高效的学习方案。

Method: 采用快捷强制目标和高效Transformer架构的世界模型，从少量数据中学习通用动作条件，主要从多样化无标签视频中提取知识。

Result: 在Minecraft中，世界模型准确预测物体交互和游戏机制，大幅超越先前模型；Dreamer 4成为首个仅从离线数据获得钻石的代理。

Conclusion: 为想象训练提供了可扩展方案，标志着向智能代理迈进的重要一步。

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

Motivation: 人类能够从少量示例中快速学习新概念，而AI系统在这方面存在挑战，特别是在数据稀缺的主观任务中需要重现这种能力。

Method: 采用人机教学架构，通过演示示例进行教学；利用领域知识扩展代理的任务理解；使用学习算法从有限示例中高效学习；优化人类选择最具代表性和最少冗余示例的策略。

Result: 在食材替换任务中，代理仅需100个示例就达到完整训练集（5万示例）一半的任务性能，通过策略性示例排序和外部符号知识的利用实现更高效泛化。

Conclusion: 通过结合策略性示例选择和利用外部知识的学习方法，AI代理能够从少量示例中高效学习主观任务，实现快速泛化。

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在通信游戏中，即使个体使用不同的信号解释也能成功协调的现象，称为"成功的误解"。研究发现虽然这种误解不会立即导致协调失败，但会阻碍与新伙伴的协调，而至少三个相互交互的个体是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设：如果个体能通过通信协调，就认为他们相互理解。探索在缺乏共同观察的情况下，个体如何发展信号词汇并协调，特别关注人类和人工智能混合群体中的通信涌现。

Method: 使用信号游戏作为代理，研究个体在仅有通信信号和交互结果（奖励）的情况下发展新信号词汇。代理开发信号、使用信号并改进解释，但不观察其他代理如何使用这些信号。

Result: 群体总是收敛到最优协调水平，但有时交互代理使用不同的信号解释（成功的误解）。使用不对齐解释的代理无法与新交互伙伴建立成功协调。至少三个相互交互的代理是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。

Conclusion: 成功的误解难以发现和修复，不会立即导致协调失败但阻碍新伙伴协调。至少三个相互交互的代理能补偿信号使用缺乏共享观察的不足，确保共享解释的出现。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在遇到超出能力边界的问题时会进行无效推理，本文发现模型能通过推理置信度和隐藏状态感知自身能力边界，并提出边界感知策略来避免无效推理，显著提升效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在面对超出能力范围的困难问题时，会持续进行无效推理直到上下文限制，既浪费计算资源又产生错误答案，需要解决模型对自身能力边界的认知问题。

Method: 通过分析推理置信度轨迹和隐藏状态，发现模型能感知能力边界：黑盒模型中可解问题置信度加速增长，不可解问题不确定性收敛；白盒模型中可解与不可解问题在推理开始前即可线性分离。基于此提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种边界感知策略。

Result: 实验表明边界感知策略能在不牺牲准确率的情况下避免无效推理，显著提升可靠性和效率，token使用量减少62.7-93.6%。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具有能力边界自我意识，通过监控推理表达和隐藏状态可以有效识别超出能力范围的问题，避免无效推理，为构建更可靠高效的推理系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,

EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的相互作用，难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场的人类推理挑战场景。

Method: 基于符号学方阵的多视角一阶逻辑推理框架，包含存在性导入检查和三值决策方案，并构建了RepublicQA基准数据集。

Result: 在RepublicQA上达到最先进性能，平均提升6.25%；在主流逻辑推理基准上平均提升7.05%。

Conclusion: 符号学基础的多视角推理能显著提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

### [202] [Query Circuits: Explaining How Language Models Answer User Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24808)
*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了查询电路方法，直接在模型内部追踪特定输入到输出的信息流，提供更忠实和计算可访问的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要揭示全局能力电路，但无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要更本地化的输入级解释。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发标准化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，并采用基于采样的方法来高效识别稀疏但忠实的电路。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，发现模型内部存在极其稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%的连接就能恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为忠实、可扩展地解释语言模型如何处理单个输入迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化训练数据的逻辑推理复杂度，并开发了重新认知优化策略来增强训练数据的推理强度，而非单纯增加数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换，而忽视了训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标分解和聚合样本的逻辑结构，并基于此提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能和泛化能力上显著优于以数据为中心的策略，并在强化学习框架下得到验证。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度而非单纯的数据规模或表面形式，对于实现大语言模型的全部认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions是一个协同进化的多智能体系统，专门用于解决物理奥林匹克竞赛问题。该系统通过三个协同工作室（视觉、逻辑、评审）和迭代优化循环，在HiPhO基准测试中实现了开源模型的重大突破，首次在IPhO中获得开源金牌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为竞争性物理学的顶峰，需要复杂的推理和深度多模态理解，但在AI研究中仍未被充分探索。现有方法主要是单模型，开源MLLM很少能达到金牌水平。

Method: 提出PhysicsMinions协同进化多智能体系统，包含三个协同工作室：视觉工作室解释图表，逻辑工作室制定解决方案，评审工作室进行双阶段验证。系统通过迭代优化循环实现协同进化，评审工作室的反馈持续指导逻辑工作室，使系统能够自我修正并收敛到真实答案。

Result: 在涵盖7个最新物理奥林匹克竞赛的HiPhO基准测试中：1）强泛化能力：持续改进不同规模的开源和闭源模型；2）历史性突破：将开源模型的金牌数从1-2个提升到6个，在最新IPhO中首次实现开源金牌；3）达到人类专家水平：在最新IPhO中Pass@32得分26.8/30，排名第4（共406名参赛者），远超最佳单模型得分22.7（排名第22）。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级别的问题解决提供了一个可泛化的框架，具有跨学科扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的社会科学研究领域较为分散，需要系统性的分类框架来整合现有研究，明确证据标准，促进该领域的累积性进展。

Method: 采用系统综述方法，结合文本嵌入、无监督聚类和主题建模技术，对270项研究进行分析，构建计算分类法。

Result: 识别出三个有机涌现的研究领域：LLM作为社会心智（关注认知、道德和偏见归因）、LLM社会（多智能体环境中的协调与制度）、LLM-人类互动（任务重塑、信任和工作影响）。

Conclusion: 该分类法为分散的研究领域提供了可复现的图谱，澄清了不同分析层次的证据标准，突出了人工智能社会科学中累积性进展的机会。

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RealUnify是一个专门评估多模态模型中视觉理解与生成能力双向协同作用的基准测试，包含1000个标注实例，通过双评估协议分析模型是否能在理解和生成之间实现有效协同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要孤立评估理解和生成能力，无法确定统一模型是否能够利用理解来增强生成，或通过生成模拟来促进更深层次的理解。

Method: 构建包含10个类别和32个子任务的RealUnify基准，围绕两个核心轴：理解增强生成（需要推理指导图像生成）和生成增强理解（需要心理模拟解决推理任务），采用端到端评估和诊断性分步评估相结合的双评估协议。

Result: 通过对12个领先统一模型和6个专业基线的评估，发现当前统一模型在实现有效协同方面仍然存在困难，表明仅靠架构统一是不够的。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索语义嵌入能否有效复制通过广泛人类调查建立的心理测量结构。

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理大语言模型嵌入，在修订版肖像价值问卷(PVQ-RR)上验证，比较多个嵌入模型和评估指标。

Result: 嵌入方法解释55%的人类数据维度相似性方差，多维缩放配置显示良好因子一致性，与理论基础一致。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量和社会科学研究提供补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Conclusion: 该框架为神经科学及其他领域提供了更通用、可扩展和自动化的理论知识与数据驱动研究整合方法

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，忽略了问题难度与模型能力之间的差异，导致对已掌握问题的低效探索和对挑战性问题缺乏有效指导，限制了学习效率和性能上限。

Method: 提出CLPO算法，利用模型自身表现进行实时难度评估构建在线课程，通过自适应问题重构机制让模型作为自己的老师：多样化中等难度问题以促进泛化，简化挑战性问题使其更易掌握。

Result: 在8个具有挑战性的数学和通用推理基准测试中实现了最先进性能，平均pass@1指标比其他方法提高了6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同演化的动态过程，为更高效地训练更具能力的推理模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限的MLLM提示，成本高且覆盖范围有限，需要高质量、多样化的下游代理任务数据集。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段方法：探索阶段让MLLM探索者系统发现新环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指导提示合成多样化、可执行、可验证的任务。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为训练MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate
adaptation strategies.

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，特别是通过组合现有技能来获得组合能力，这与人类学习新认知技能的机制相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中是否真正教授新技能，还是仅仅重新加权现有推理策略，解决关于RL作用的持续争论。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力，研究LLM在RL训练后能否学习未见过的函数组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: RL使LLM能够学习未见过的函数组合，这种组合能力能泛化到更复杂的问题（如>2个函数的组合），并且能迁移到不同的目标任务。

Conclusion: RL能从根本上改变模型的推理行为，让LLM获得真正的新技能，建议先构建具有基本技能的基座模型，然后用RL激励高级、可泛化的技能来解决复杂问题。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RLHI（基于人类交互的强化学习）范式，通过从真实用户对话中学习来实现持续模型改进和多方面对齐。包含两种方法：用户引导改写和基于用户奖励的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预先标注的专家生成的人类反馈进行对齐，但为了持续改进和实现多方面对齐，未来模型需要从自然的人类交互中学习。

Method: 1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites：根据用户的自然语言后续回复来修订不满意的模型输出；2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards：通过学习基于用户长期交互历史（称为persona）的奖励模型来进行学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 自然的人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过多视角文本描述增强视觉语言导航中的类比推理能力，提升导航性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本LLM视觉语言导航方法要么将图像编码为文本场景描述而简化视觉细节，要么处理原始图像输入而无法捕捉高层次推理所需的抽象语义

Method: 通过多视角文本描述促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理增强全局场景理解和空间推理

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验显示导航性能显著提升

Conclusion: 多视角文本描述和类比推理能有效增强导航代理的上下文理解能力

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了ReasoningBank记忆框架，从智能体的成功和失败经验中提炼可泛化的推理策略，并通过内存感知的测试时扩展(MaTTS)加速学习过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型智能体在持续任务中无法从交互历史中学习，导致重复错误和效率低下

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体自我评估的成功和失败经验中提取推理策略，MaTTS通过增加计算资源来生成丰富多样的经验，提升记忆质量

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，MaTTS进一步放大了这些收益

Conclusion: 内存驱动的经验扩展成为一种新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在需要串行视觉处理的任务中表现不如人类，这种性能差距与任务复杂度呈正相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务中却不如人类，假设是缺乏视觉基础的串行处理能力。

Method: 比较人类和VLM在三个领域的表现：几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转，通过操纵任务复杂度来改变串行处理需求。

Result: 所有领域都显示VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加（作为串行处理负载的代理）呈强相关，任务越复杂，VLM与人类性能差距越大。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在串行、视觉基础的推理能力上存在根本性瓶颈，这解释了其与人类表现的差异。

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

TL;DR: UniAPL是一个统一的对齐学习框架，通过单阶段训练同时利用演示偏好和比较偏好数据，解决传统SFT+RL流程中的分布不匹配问题，实现更高效和稳定的模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT后接RL的对齐方法存在关键问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，导致SFT知识变得脆弱；RL探索时无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识，造成低效更新。两种数据源分离阻碍了相互正则化。

Method: 将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习。在每个梯度步骤中，密集的专家演示直接对在线探索进行正则化，固有地解决分布不匹配问题。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上评估，使用Qwen3-235B-Instruct作为教师模型。UniAPL模型匹配或超越强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（匹配32B模型性能），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超越教师模型。响应长度和对数概率分布分析确认UniAPL输出紧密模仿专家演示。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一的对齐学习框架，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，有效解决了传统方法中的分布不匹配问题，最大化数据协同效应。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有偏见和脆弱性，在学术同行评审等敏感场景中需要区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法无法有效处理判断检测任务。

Method: 开发J-Detector检测器，使用显式提取的语言学和LLM增强特征，将LLM法官的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行检测。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验证明J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM法官的偏见，验证了判断检测在实际场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: 判断检测是可行的，J-Detector能够有效检测LLM生成的判断，并分析影响检测性的关键因素，为实际应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
