Our experiments\nacross 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric\nvehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2\nto 99.7% accuracy with FGA.

Planning involves\nstructuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible\ncontinuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively\ntransformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and\nencumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on\nvector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact\nsummary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing\nsystematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.\nUsing this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,\npath-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key\naspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent\nto which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the\nreliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these\nquestions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and\ncontribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs\nand deep learning systems.

In this context,\nwe address the need for explainable physical-layer attack detection methods.\nFirst, we analyze the inner workings of various classifiers trained to alert\nabout physical layer intrusions, examining how the influence of different\nmonitored parameters varies depending on the type of attack being detected.\nThis analysis not only improves the interpretability of the models but also\nsuggests ways to enhance their design for increased speed. In the second part,\nwe evaluate the detectors' resilience to malicious parameter noising. The\nresults highlight a key trade-off between model speed and resilience. This work\nserves as a design guideline for developing fast and robust detectors trained\non available network monitoring data."}

In recent years, various automated\nFault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in\nidentifying errors in programs.

Most approaches operate at the method\nlevel without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for\nstudents who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While\nsome approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on\npredicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to\nLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,\nexplainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via\nLLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual\ninformation specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying\nfaulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the\nLLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both\nlocalization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we\nintroduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from\nmultiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line.

Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption\nof mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps.\nFrequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we\nexplore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings\nin Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell\nrefactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps.\nRefactoring of the code smells \"Duplicated code\" and \"Type checking\" reduce\nenergy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption,\nhowever, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of\nexecution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell\nrefactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order\nin which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that\nsome permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy\nconsumption for the analyzed apps.

We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo\nTree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that\nrely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into\nthe training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit\nassignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,\nDeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,\nwhich leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training\nsteps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that\nprioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with\nentropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)\nadaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.\nExperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves\n62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B\nreasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training\napproaches.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing\nbelief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,\nshowing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs\nscale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from\n44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR\nand position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR."}

This prevents the agent from\nbeing useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a\nsoftware engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer\nduring code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an\nautomated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,\nimproves readability, implements a feature).\n  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be\nmanually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses\nfrom a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower\ndeveloper productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In\nthis paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided\nby a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high\nlevel, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's\nresponse and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis\ntools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.\n  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable\nerrors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the\nuninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to\nvalidate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program\nequivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8\nincorrect judgments made by the agent."}

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

Based on this observation, we propose\nHiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts\nstyle embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate\ncontrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.\nAdditionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the\ncomplementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory\npreferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual\nprompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when\napplied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style\ncontrollability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while\npreserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.\nAudio samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/HiStyle-2517/."}

As\ntense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often\ncomply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed\nin current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.\nIn this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,\nmechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific\nvulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the\nspecific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the\ntense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector\nto recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it\ninto a \"preventative fine-tuning\", forcing the model to learn a more robust\nrefusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack\nsuccess rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and\nminimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and\nutility.

Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight\nkey texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example\nlearning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,\nthe performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional\nmedicine.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

Current attack methods on malicious instructions\nare often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting\nwith semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We\npropose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that\nexploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,\nour method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the\ntarget query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative\ntheory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while\nconcealing the malicious event as the hidden climax.
