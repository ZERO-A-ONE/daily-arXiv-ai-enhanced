Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

Existing\nmethods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,\noverlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically\ninconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme\nnamed Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates\ncontext-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,\nensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of\npre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an\nadversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing\nmodel misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This\ncomprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective\nadversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86DP-SGD\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210DP\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30DP\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DP-SGD\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08Diffusion\u3001VAE\u3001GAN\uff09\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210DP\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c11\u4e2a\u6548\u7528\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "DP-SGD\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cGAN\u5728DP-SGD\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "DP\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ec5\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

This paper outlines how adaptive\ncontrol over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new\nmulti-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious\ndeployment policies.

When\ndevelopers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted\ntechnical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its\ncategories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing\nsuch taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding\ncode, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to\nannotator subjectivity. This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward\nautomating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a\ncomment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation\nfor each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to\nconstruct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains:\nquantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully\nrecovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer\nConfiguration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN\nproduces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven,\niterative design.

The design is\nevaluated in three areas: Resource Utilization For m=163, the hybrid design\nuses 6,812 LUTs, a 39.82% reduction compared to conventional methods. For\nm=233, LUT usage reduces by 45.53% and 70.70% compared to overlap-free and\nbit-parallel implementations. Delay Performance For m=163, achieves 13.31ns\ndelay, improving by 37.60% over bit-parallel implementations. For m=233,\nmaintains 13.39ns delay. Area-Delay Product For m=163, achieves ADP of 90,860,\noutperforming bit-parallel (75,337) and digit-serial (43,179) implementations.\nFor m=233, demonstrates 16.86% improvement over overlap-free and 96.10% over\nbit-parallel designs. Results show the hybrid technique significantly improves\nspeed, hardware efficiency, and resource utilization for ECC cryptographic\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u57dfGF(2^m)\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e58\u6cd5\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08CM\uff09\u548cKaratsuba\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08KM\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u692d\u5706\u66f2\u7ebf\u70b9\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08ECPM\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u692d\u5706\u66f2\u7ebf\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\uff08ECC\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6d41\u516c\u94a5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e58\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316ECC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u7528CM\u5904\u7406\u8f83\u5c0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\uff08\u598241\u4f4d\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09\uff0cKM\u5904\u7406\u8f83\u5927\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002\u9488\u5bf9NIST B-163\u3001233\u3001283\u548c571\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\uff08\u5982LUT\u51cf\u5c1139.82%\u81f370.70%\uff09\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e37.60%\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u79ef\uff08ADP\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u4e58\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u5728ECC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Distinct from general federated scenarios, FR\ninherently needs to preserve client-specific parameters, i.e., user embeddings,\nfor privacy and personalization. However, we empirically find that globally\naggregated item embeddings can induce skew in user embeddings, resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. To this end, we theoretically analyze the user\nembedding skew issue and propose Personalized Federated recommendation with\nCalibration via Low-Rank decomposition (PFedCLR). Specifically, PFedCLR\nintroduces an integrated dual-function mechanism, implemented with a buffer\nmatrix, to jointly calibrate local user embedding and personalize global item\nembeddings.

Recent research demonstrates that attackers can\nefficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute\nbackdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns\nare present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks\nrely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking\nthe potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor\nAttacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor\ntriggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing\nmechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a\ncooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most\ninfluential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose\na gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude\nunder environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms\nand nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack\nsuccess rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.\nThese results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of\nprincipled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks.

At the same time, SHI is already common in\ncommercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This\nstudy clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to\ncontribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential\ninsights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry\npractice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to\nidentify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and\nuncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical\nunderstandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To\nunderstand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we\nthen conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)\nwith AI practitioners.

This paper explores an approach to\nassess how a safety case is supported by its claims and evidence, toward\nestablishing credibility for the overall case. Starting from a description of\nthe building blocks of a safety case (claims, evidence, and optional\nformat-dependent entries), this paper delves into the assessment of support of\neach claim through the provided evidence. Two domains of assessment are\noutlined for each claim: procedural support (formalizing process specification)\nand implementation support (demonstrating process application). Additionally,\nan assessment of evidence status is also undertaken, independently from the\nclaims support. Scoring strategies and evaluation guidelines are provided,\nincluding detailed scoring tables for claim support and evidence status\nassessment. The paper further discusses governance, continual improvement, and\ntiming considerations for safety case assessments. Reporting of results and\nfindings is contextualized within its primary use for internal decision-making\non continual improvement efforts. The presented approach builds on state of the\nart auditing practices, but specifically tackles the question of judging the\ncredibility of a safety case. While not conclusive on its own, it provides a\nstarting point toward a comprehensive \"Case Credibility Assessment\" (CCA),\nstarting from the evaluation of the support for each claim (individually and in\naggregate), as well as every piece of evidence provided.

By systematically reviewing academic publications, technical white\npapers, and industry reports from recent years, this study synthesizes key\nthemes and implementation strategies.

We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a\npublic challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants\nadaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to\ntrigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge\nspanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval\nconfigurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions\nfrom 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of\nsubmissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new\ninsights into the instruction-data separation problem.
