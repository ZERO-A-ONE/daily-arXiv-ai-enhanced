Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been\nemployed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified\nagent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit\nsophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face\nsignificant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based\nsimulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like\nsocieties at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social\nprocesses as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed\nby a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event\nqueue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component\noptimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one\nbillion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion\npropagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's\nhigh fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information\ndiffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more\nstable and realistic emergent behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Light Society \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8fc7\u5341\u4ebf\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ABMs\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800c LLMs \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6311\u6218\u3002Light Society \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Light Society \u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7531\u4e00\u7ec4 LLM \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u961f\u5217\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u4efb\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u610f\u89c1\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u8fbe\u5341\u4ebf\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Light Society \u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To enhance the\nsecurity and trust for TLS 1.3 in such scenarios, we propose LURK-T, a provably\nsecure framework which allows for limited use of remote keys with added trust\nin TLS 1.3. We efficiently decouple the server side of TLS 1.3 into a LURK-T\nCrypto Service (CS) and a LURK-T Engine (E). CS executes all cryptographic\noperations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), upon E's requests. CS and\nE together provide the whole TLS-server functionality. A major benefit of our\nconstruction is that it is application agnostic; the LURK-T Crypto Service\ncould be collocated with the LURK-T Engine, or it could run on different\nmachines. Thus, our design allows for in situ attestation and protection of the\ncryptographic side of the TLS server, as well as for all setups of CDNs over\nTLS. To support such a generic decoupling, we provide a full Application\nProgramming Interface (API) for LURK-T.

This highlights the dual\nnature of these technologies as both the source of new threats and the\nessential tool for their mitigation. Integrating LLMs into clinical diagnostics\nalso raises concerns about accuracy, bias, and safety, needing strong\ngovernance. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of 455 references, this paper\npresents a survey of LLM and GenAI risks. We propose a strategic roadmap and\noperational blueprint integrating policy auditing (CCPA, GDPR), fraud\ndetection, and compliance automation, and an advanced LLM-DA stack with modular\ncomponents including multi LLM routing, agentic memory, and governance layers\nto enhance platform integrity. We also provide actionable insights,\ncross-functional best practices, and real-world case studies.

Our development of LEA reveals a progression of\nindependency in hidden states of LLMs: heavy reliance on context in early\nlayers, which enables the derivation of LEA; increased independency in later\nlayers, which sheds light on why scale is essential for LLM's effectiveness.\nThis work provides security analysts a means to audit LLM-assisted workflows,\nlaying the groundwork for transparent, high-assurance deployments of\nRAG-enhanced LLMs in cybersecurity operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLEA\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316LLM\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0cLLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LLM\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LEA\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30100\u4e2a\u5173\u952eCVE\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "LEA\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5ba1\u8ba1LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aRAG\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u90e8\u7f72\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

System-level defenses have recently shown\npromise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key\nchallenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for\nmemory stream isolation.

A Secure Planner first\nconstructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter\nchecklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator\nthen monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes\ncomply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection\nIsolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user\nquery from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks.

However, their potential to generate harmful responses has\nraised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when\nmanipulated by adversarial techniques known as \"jailbreak\" attacks. Existing\njailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or\nsuffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms\nof these models.\n  In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic\ncomplexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any\nadded prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs\ndirectly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.\n  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a\njailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,\ninformation-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.\nSpecifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase\nmalicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is\nunsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the\nfailure while preserving its malicious intent.\n  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used\nLLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their\njailbreak success rates.

Attackers can implant latent triggers\nthat persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model\nbehavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense\nmechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker\nknowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce\nInverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under\nminimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack\ntargets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods\nthat rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune\neffectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key\ncomponents, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically,\nInverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation,\nprobabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response\npatterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to\nreconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis.

We evaluate\nthem across two bug scenarios (enterprise-grades and algorithmic), three\nlanguages (Java, C/C++, Python), and four prompting strategies, analyzing over\n600K generated patches on six benchmarks. Key findings include: (1) model\nspecialization (e.g., CodeLlama) can outperform larger general-purpose models\n(e.g., LLaMA); (2) repair performance does not scale linearly with model size;\n(3) correct patches often appear early in generation; and (4) prompts\nsignificantly affect results.

With modern mobile\ndevices often featuring network interfaces, state-of-the-art signals of\nopportunity (SOP) schemes can provide accurate network positions in replacement\nof GNSS. The use of onboard inertial sensors can also assist in the absence of\nGNSS, possibly in the presence of jammers. The combination of SOP and inertial\nsensors has received limited attention, yet it shows strong results on fully\ncustom-built platforms.

Our Position-based Attack Detection Scheme (PADS) is a\nprobabilistic framework that uses regression and uncertainty analysis for\npositions. The regression optimization problem is a weighted mean square error\nof polynomial fitting, with constraints that the fitted positions satisfy the\ndevice velocity and acceleration. Then, uncertainty is modeled by a Gaussian\nprocess, which provides more flexibility to analyze how sure or unsure we are\nabout position estimations. In the detection process, we combine all\nuncertainty information with the position estimations into a fused test\nstatistic, which is the input utilized by an anomaly detector based on outlier\nensembles. The evaluation shows that the PADS outperforms a set of baseline\nmethods that rely on SOP or inertial sensor-based or statistical tests,\nachieving up to 3 times the true positive rate at a low false positive rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u7684GNSS\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff08PADS\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c11\u7528GNSS\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9a\u5236\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\uff09\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4bGNSS\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "PADS\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u62df\u5408\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u56de\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u6790\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "PADS\u5728\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad83\u500d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PADS\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684GNSS\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, FM providers\nintroduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct\ntool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto\nstandard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption,\nMCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to\nsustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination.\n  Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP.\nUsing state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining\na general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we\nevaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and\nmaintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we\nidentify eight distinct vulnerabilities-only three overlapping with traditional\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general\nvulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding\nmaintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain ten bug patterns\noverlapping prior research. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific\nvulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional\nanalysis and refactoring practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Model Context Protocol (MCP)\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "MCP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5176\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548cMCP\u4e13\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f301,899\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b08\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c7.2%\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u542b\u901a\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c5.5%\u5b58\u5728MCP\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff1b66%\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\uff0c14.4%\u542b\u5df2\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5f00\u53d1MCP\u4e13\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ecd\u5177\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
