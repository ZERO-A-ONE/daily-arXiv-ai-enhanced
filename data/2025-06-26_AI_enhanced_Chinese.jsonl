Notwithstanding, such developments lead to\nnew challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade.\nThis study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient\nenergy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research\ninterlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence\n(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy\nmarket, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and\nmarket reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2\nmillion anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer\n(P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American\nmicrogrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record\ncontains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume\n(kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier\n(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement\nconfirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior\nmetrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical\npricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of\ntwo layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer,\neach playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing\nand market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this\nresearch were specifically chosen for their established high performance in\nclassification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction\nfraud in decentralized markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u4ea4\u6613\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u9762\u4e34\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e24\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u6e90\u4ea4\u6613\u6b3a\u8bc8\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e120\u4e07\u6761\u6a21\u62df\u4ea4\u6613\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It is crucial for ensuring the security and\nefficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms\nhave demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the\nabsence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable\nto emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach\nto conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate\nthat an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model\ndetails, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a\n99\\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and\nclaims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially\nbypassing compromised detection systems.

However,\nexisting work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code\nwritten for government applications. In particular, government enterprise\nsoftware is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language\ncode (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context\nwindow size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are\nprimarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited\ntesting with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy\nlanguages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines\nthe application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written\nin ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We\ninvestigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary\nmodule comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking\nmethods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including\nGPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs\ncan select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning.

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining\ntask accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a\ndiffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes\nsemantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with\nself-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance.

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g.

Existing solutions often\ndepend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as\nblockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited\nadaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a\ndecentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically\nevaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,\nmessage latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model\naggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was\nintegrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST\nand CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to\n25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack\nintensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results\ndemonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,\nachieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for\nCIFAR-10 cases.

Phishing attacks often lead to operational\nincidents and data breaches. As a result, many organizations allocate a\nsubstantial portion of their cybersecurity budgets to phishing awareness\ntraining, driven in part by compliance requirements. However, the effectiveness\nof this training remains in dispute. Empirical evidence of training\n(in)effectiveness is essential for evidence-based cybersecurity investment and\npolicy development. Despite recent measurement studies, two critical gaps\nremain in the literature:\n  (1) we lack a validated measure of phishing lure difficulty, and\n  (2) there are few comparisons of different types of training in real-world\nbusiness settings.\n  To fill these gaps, we conducted a large-scale study ($N = 12{,}511$) of\nphishing effectiveness at a US-based financial technology (``fintech'') firm.\nOur two-factor design compared the effect of treatments (lecture-based,\ninteractive, and control groups) on subjects' susceptibility to phishing lures\nof varying complexity (using the NIST Phish Scale).

This\nmotivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when\ndebating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,\nand can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported\nthat large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive\nbiases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward\nidentity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate\nwhether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic\nattributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and\nproprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity\ndiscernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific\nevidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity\ndiscernment relative to models without personas. Political personas\nspecifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific\nevidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced\npolitical identity.

We propose\nDiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into\nclinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result\ninterpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world\nmedical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we\ndesign a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to\nits corresponding description and classifies test results as \"normal\" or\n\"abnormal\". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for\nevidence acquisition and automated diagnosis.

[Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends\nLean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data\nSource Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical\nconstraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and\nvalidated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both\nstatic validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world\nindustrial case study).

The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,\nthough some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be\nmitigated by expert facilitation.

In practical settings,\nhowever, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often\nbefore previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes\nthe WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same\nsite as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,\nresulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we\nconsider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses\nmultiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,\nand similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,\nthereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named\nADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation\nto salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention\ncropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features\nfrom both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules\nto capture the global contextual patterns of the trace.

(CCS 2023) extended this concept by proposing\nmulti-key BFV/CKKS variants, referred to as the CDKS scheme. These variants\nincorporate asymptotically optimal techniques to facilitate secure computation\nacross multiple data providers. In this paper, we identify a critical security\nvulnerability in the CDKS scheme when applied to multiparty secure computation\ntasks, such as privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL).

Existing security paradigms often fail to\naddress a foundational \"Trinity of Trust,\" comprising the fidelity of the\nsystem model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the\nanalytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC\nframework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,\nclosed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based \"Blue Agent\" defender is\ncontinuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats\ndiscovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to\nbecome progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously\nprobe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the\nTEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A\ncomprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including\nROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is\nresponsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.\nBy integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC\narchitecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a\nnecessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future\nof critical infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faARC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u6790\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ea2\u84dd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "IT\u4e0eOT\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u9632\u5fa1\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e09\u8981\u7d20\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u540c\u6b65\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u64ce\u97e7\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ARC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ea2\u4ee3\u7406\uff08DRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u84dd\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u96c6\u6210\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728TEP\u548cSWaT\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

However, the assumption of source code is\ncontrary to typical binary scenarios where only the binary is available. In\nthis work, we investigate an approach with minimal assumptions and a sound\napproach to disassembly error evaluation that does not require source code. Any\nsource code does not address the fundamental problem of binary disassembly and\nfails when only the binary exists. As far as we know, this is the first work to\nevaluate disassembly errors using only the binary. We propose TraceBin, which\nuses dynamic execution to find disassembly errors. TraceBin targets the use\ncase where the disassembly is used in an automated fashion for security tasks\non a target binary, such as static binary instrumentation, binary hardening,\nautomated code repair, and so on, which may be affected by disassembly errors.\nDiscovering disassembly errors in the target binary aids in reducing problems\ncaused by such errors. Furthermore, we are not aware of existing approaches\nthat can evaluate errors given only a target binary, as they require source\ncode. Our evaluation shows TraceBin finds: (i) errors consistent with existing\nstudies even without source; (ii) disassembly errors due to control flow; (iii)\nnew interesting errors; (iv) errors in non-C/C++ binaries; (v) errors in\nclosed-source binaries; and (vi) show that disassembly errors can have\nsignificant security implications. Overall, our experimental results show that\nTraceBin finds many errors in existing popular disassemblers.

This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,\nthat supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep\nReinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task\nassignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for\npartial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a\nbusiness process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of\nprevious work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process\ndecisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process\ndecision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling\nof the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "GymPN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u591a\u51b3\u7b56\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u53d1GymPN\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u591a\u51b3\u7b56\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GymPN\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GymPN\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6d41\u7a0b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable\ncapabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced\nreasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond\nmonolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent\nsystems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more\neffectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel\nmulti-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security\nverification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification\nquestion answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan\nand property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug\nvalidation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow.

However, a critical\ngap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,\nparticularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent\nfeatures complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in\ncurrent approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.\nHence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that\naddresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system\naccess or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box\nconstraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect\nreal-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using\nchange-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive\nfeatures to perturbations.

However, ToM and other multi-agent\nabilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from\nnarrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus\npropose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in\nall other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing\ninteractive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nof frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We\nfind that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple\nword-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive\nscience experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.\nSurprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly\nworse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that\nDecrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and\npaves the path towards better artificial agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Decrypto\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5177\u5907\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9LLMs\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u548cToM\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDecrypto\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fToM\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u548cToM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u65b0\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Decrypto\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u548cToM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}
