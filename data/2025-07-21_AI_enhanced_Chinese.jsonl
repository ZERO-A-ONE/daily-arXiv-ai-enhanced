GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies\nas nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution\nand dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a\nBrain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency\ngraphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,\nanalysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware\ntoken management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed\narchitecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility\nenvironments.

PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy.

Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies.

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u6ce8\u91cd\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

While existing Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex\narchitectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer\nfrom scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.\nIn this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates\nshort-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE\nconsists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most\nrecent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware\nmodule that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence\nof globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an\nadaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on\ndata characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop\nmessage passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant\nimprovements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal\ngraphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance\nagainst state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,\ndelivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAGLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u65b0\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709T-GNNs\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "EAGLE\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e24\u8005\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6216\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0cEAGLE\u5728\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709T-GNNs\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc750\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EAGLE\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86T-GNNs\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions).

Our study highlights the\nfeasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted\nknowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology\nmatching at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "KROMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u672c\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u672c\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u672c\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0cKROMA\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u548cRAG\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "KROMA\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u672c\u4f53\u7ec6\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKROMA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "KROMA\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u7ec6\u5316\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672c\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUDA-L1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316CUDA\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CUDA\u5185\u6838\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8GPU\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316CUDA\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728CUDA\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CUDA-L1\u3002", "method": "CUDA-L1\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6216\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA A100\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cCUDA-L1\u5728KernelBench\u7684250\u4e2aCUDA\u5185\u6838\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u901f17.7\u500d\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u8fbe449\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5176\u4ed6GPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CUDA-L1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316CUDA\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GPU\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u538b\u529b\u3002"}}
