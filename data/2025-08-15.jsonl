FL offers formal security guarantees when\ncombined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,\nhowever, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical\nutility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often\npresent in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear\ntrade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the\noptimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal\noperational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong\nprivacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high\nclinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a\npractical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate\ndiagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare\ndata."}

Our analysis\nindicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain\nfail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing\ntransactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial\nadvancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from\nthe critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update\nmechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data\nstructure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput\nof 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically\ndocumented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most\nhigh-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.\n  AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a\nwide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran\ncould enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to\noffer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.\n  When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects,\nAlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran\nachieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an\nidentical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an\nattractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data\ncapabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further\nenhances performance.
