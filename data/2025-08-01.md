### [1] [On LLM-Assisted Generation of Smart Contracts from Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23087)
*Fabian Stiehle,Hans Weytjens,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）从业务流程描述生成智能合约代码的可行性，并提出了一个自动化评估框架。研究发现，LLMs在生成可靠智能合约代码方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的代码生成方法存在局限性，而LLMs在代码生成方面展现出潜力，但其可靠性和执行正确性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 通过自动化评估框架，测试不同类型和大小的LLMs在生成智能合约代码时的表现，重点关注流程执行的关键属性。

Result: LLMs在生成智能合约代码时未能达到所需的完美可靠性，尤其是在流程执行、资源分配和数据条件方面。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索如何将LLMs负责任地集成到现有代码生成工具中，以提高输出可靠性。本文的评估框架可作为此类集成的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

### [2] [FlowETL: An Autonomous Example-Driven Pipeline for Data Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23118)
*Mattia Di Profio,Mingjun Zhong,Yaji Sripada,Marcel Jaspars*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FlowETL是一种基于示例的自主ETL管道架构，旨在自动标准化和准备输入数据集，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ETL解决方案需要大量人工设计特定于上下文的转换，缺乏自动化能力。

Method: FlowETL通过规划引擎和ETL工作器构建并应用转换计划，同时提供监控和日志功能。

Result: 在14个不同领域、文件结构和大小的数据集上展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlowETL为ETL自动化提供了有效的解决方案，减少了人工干预需求。

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

### [3] [Vibe Modeling: Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23120)
*Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合AI和模型驱动工程（MDE）的“vibe modeling”方法，以加速可靠复杂系统的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件开发方法难以应对日益增长的需求和复杂性，同时AI驱动的编码方法存在漏洞和可维护性问题。

Method: 提出“vibe modeling”概念，整合AI和MDE的优势。

Result: 概述了vibe modeling的关键概念及其潜力。

Conclusion: vibe modeling为未来建模提供了新机遇，但也面临挑战。

Abstract: There is a pressing need for better development methods and tools to keep up
with the growing demand and increasing complexity of new software systems. New
types of user interfaces, the need for intelligent components, sustainability
concerns, ... bring new challenges that we need to handle. In the last years,
model-driven engineering (MDE) has been key to improving the quality and
productivity of software development, but models themselves are becoming
increasingly complex to specify and manage. At the same time, we are witnessing
the growing popularity of vibe coding approaches that rely on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to transform natural language descriptions into running code at
the expenses of code vulnerabilities, scalability issues and maintainability
concerns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{vibe modeling} as
a novel approach to integrate the best of both worlds (AI and MDE) to speed up
the development of reliable complex systems. We outline the key concepts of
vibe modeling and highlight the opportunities and open challenges it presents
for the future of modeling.

### [4] [Extension Decisions in Open Source Software Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23168)
*Elmira Onagh,Maleknaz Nayebi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究GitHub Marketplace中CI工具的功能冗余现象，发现65%的新工具在六个月内复制现有功能，并分析了先行者的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub Marketplace中CI工具数量快速增长，但许多新工具功能重复，研究旨在分析这一现象及其影响。

Method: 通过链接6,983个CI Actions到3,869个提供者，并挖掘其版本历史，构建图模型以跟踪功能发布和冗余工具聚类。

Result: 约65%的新CI工具在六个月内复制现有功能，少数先行者工具主导了后续的分支和扩展。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者提供了选择最佳发布时机和定位未满足功能的依据，同时帮助维护者减少冗余工具，并公开数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: GitHub Marketplace is expanding by approximately 41% annually, with new
tools; however, many additions replicate existing functionality. We study this
phenomenon in the platform's largest segment, Continuous Integration (CI), by
linking 6,983 CI Actions to 3,869 providers and mining their version histories.
Our graph model timestamps every functionality's debut, tracks its adoption,
and clusters redundant tools. We find that approximately 65% of new CI Actions
replicate existing capabilities, typically within six months, and that a small
set of first-mover Actions accounts for most subsequent forks and extensions.
These insights enable developers to choose the optimal moment to launch, target
unmet functionality, and help maintainers eliminate redundant tools. We publish
the complete graph and dataset to encourage longitudinal research on innovation
and competition in software ecosystems, and to provide practitioners with a
data-driven roadmap for identifying emerging trends and guiding product
strategy.

### [5] [AutoBridge: Automating Smart Device Integration with Centralized Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23178)
*Siyuan Liu,Zhice Yang,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoBridge自动化生成物联网设备集成代码，通过分阶段调试确保正确性，显著减少人工干预，成功率和功能覆盖率均超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物联网设备集成需要大量人工编程，AutoBridge旨在自动化这一过程，降低复杂性和人力成本。

Method: 采用分而治之策略，先生成设备控制逻辑，再合成平台兼容代码，并通过多阶段调试确保正确性。

Result: 在34个设备上测试，平均成功率达93.87%，功能覆盖率达94.87%；用户反馈后可达100%。

Conclusion: AutoBridge在代码准确性和效率上显著优于人工编程，展示了自动化物联网集成的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

### [6] [XABPs: Towards eXplainable Autonomous Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23269)
*Peter Fettke,Fabiana Fournier,Lior Limonad,Andreas Metzger,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出可解释的自主业务流程（XABPs），以解决自主业务流程（ABPs）带来的信任、调试、责任、偏见和合规性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABPs虽能提升效率和降低成本，但可能引发信任、调试、责任等问题，需通过可解释性解决。

Method: 提出系统化方法，包括XABPs的形式分类、解释性结构设计，并识别关键研究挑战。

Result: XABPs能增强系统透明度，帮助解决ABPs的潜在问题。

Conclusion: XABPs是解决ABPs问题的有效途径，需进一步研究其实现方法。

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

### [7] [SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23348)
*Han Li,Yuling Shi,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Heng Lian,Xin Wang,Yantao Jia,Tao Huang,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate是一种竞争性多代理辩论框架，通过多样化推理路径和代码依赖图遍历，提升问题定位能力，并在SWE-bench基准测试中取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理框架在独立探索中易陷入局部解，难以识别跨代码库的问题模式，SWE-Debate旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过代码依赖图生成多个故障传播路径，组织三轮辩论，由不同视角的代理协作形成修复计划，最后通过MCTS代理生成补丁。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，SWE-Debate表现优于基线，达到最新最优水平。

Conclusion: SWE-Debate通过多代理辩论框架有效提升了问题定位和修复能力，为复杂软件工程任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

translation within IBM's watsonx Code Assistant for Z (WCA4Z). The system
addresses key challenges in evaluating LLM-based translators, including model
opacity and the complexity of translation quality assessment. Our approach

scalable, multi-faceted evaluations. The system supports continuous integration
workflows, enables large-scale benchmarking, and reduces reliance on manual
review. We describe the system architecture, evaluation strategies, and
reporting mechanisms that provide actionable insights for developers and
project managers, facilitating the evolution of high-quality, modernized
codebases.

### [9] [SWE-Exp: Experience-Driven Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23361)

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Exp通过从先前的修复经验中提取可操作知识，解决了LLM代理在软件问题解决中缺乏记忆的问题，实现了持续学习和更高的解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在解决软件问题时缺乏记忆，无法复用先前经验，导致冗余探索和效率低下。

Method: SWE-Exp引入了一个多方面的经验库，从高级问题理解到具体代码变更，提取并复用修复经验。

Result: 实验显示SWE-Exp在SWE-bench-Verified上达到了41.6%的Pass@1解决率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SWE-Exp通过经验驱动的修复策略，为自动化软件工程代理提供了持续学习和高效问题解决的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在探索大型集成空间和仓库级理解方面存在局限性，影响了整体效果。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，Trae Agent平均性能提升10.22%，Pass@1得分达75.20%，排名第一。

Conclusion: Trae Agent是一种高效的仓库级问题解决方法，已开源以支持研究社区。

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at
https://github.com/bytedance/trae-agent.

### [12] [An Empirical Study on the Amount of Changes Required for Merge Request Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23640)
*Samah Kansab,Mohammed Sayagh,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码审查（CR）中的工作量，基于GitLab合并请求（MRs）的数据集，发现71%的MRs需要调整，28%涉及200行以上代码修改。通过机器学习模型预测CR工作量，AUC达0.84-0.88。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注基于代码修改量的CR工作量，尤其是在GitLab MRs背景下。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用23,600多个MRs的数据集，定义CR工作量为提交后的代码修改量，并训练可解释的机器学习模型。

Result: 71%的MRs需要调整，28%涉及200行以上修改。模型AUC为0.84-0.88，复杂度、经验和文本特征是关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 机器学习可有效解释和预测CR工作量，复杂度、经验和历史项目特征是重要影响因素。

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

### [13] [Fine-Grained Privacy Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems via Knowledge Asymmetry Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23229)
*Yufei Chen,Yao Wang,Haibin Zhang,Tao Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黑盒攻击框架，通过知识不对称性实现跨领域的隐私提取，并利用链式思维推理策略减少敏感内容暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的隐私攻击方法在多领域应用中缺乏鲁棒性，且难以准确识别知识库来源的句子。

Method: 采用链式思维推理策略，分解对抗查询以最大化信息差异，并通过语义关系评分解决歧义，最后训练神经网络识别隐私信息。

Result: 在单领域和多领域场景中分别达到91%和83%的隐私提取率，敏感句子暴露减少65%。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了RAG系统攻击与防御之间的空白，为自适应缓解提供了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, but this advancement introduces
significant privacy risks. Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger
data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived
sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across
multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel
black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and
standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous
knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that
creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content.
Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information
disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and
syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature
scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike
prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative
refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we
achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in
multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in
case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG
systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a
foundation for adaptive mitigation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种防御LLM评估系统免受提示注入攻击的框架SE+CFE，通过标准评估和反事实评估结合，显著提升了安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLM评估系统中存在的盲攻击威胁，即候选答案独立于真实答案设计以欺骗评估者。

Method: 方法是通过标准评估（SE）与反事实评估（CFE）结合，重新评估提交答案在故意错误条件下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，标准评估易受攻击，而SE+CFE框架显著提高了攻击检测率，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: 结论是SE+CFE框架能有效防御盲攻击，提升LLM评估系统的安全性。

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

### [15] [LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611)
*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用LLMs（如gpt-4o-mini）分析感染截图以提取IoCs、追踪恶意活动的新方法，解决了传统日志分析的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注主动检测恶意软件，而忽略了利用感染截图等反应性分析手段。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过LLMs处理Aurora信息窃取木马的感染截图，提取URL、安装文件等IoCs，并关联分析以识别恶意活动。

Result: 从1000张截图中提取了337个可操作URL和246个相关文件，识别出3个恶意活动。

Conclusion: 该方法为威胁情报提供了可扩展的反应性分析手段，有助于早期干预。

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BIKE密码系统中多项式环上的秩2格，以推广弱密钥恢复方法并发现更多潜在弱密钥。

Method: 构建了一个秩2格，并基于最短向量问题（SVP）的方法，进一步生成了格的约简基。

Result: 证明了之前的方法隐含解决了所构建格的最短向量问题，并利用约简基发现了更多弱密钥。

Conclusion: 通过约简基方法，可以更有效地检测BIKE密码系统中的弱密钥。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a rank $2$ lattice over a polynomial ring arising
from the public key of the BIKE cryptosystem \cite{aragon2022bike}. The secret
key is a sparse vector in this lattice. We study properties of this lattice and
generalize the recovery of weak keys from \cite{BardetDLO16}. In particular, we
show that they implicitly solved a shortest vector problem in the lattice we
constructed. Rather than finding only a shortest vector, we obtain a reduced
basis of the lattice which makes it possible to check for more weak keys.

Conclusion: 该研究为KGC解释性研究提供了统一框架和评估标准，旨在推动该领域的可重复性和影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据准备原则（DRAI）在领导级科学数据集中的应用，提出了一个针对高性能计算环境的二维准备框架，用于指导AI训练的数据转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决科学数据在AI训练中的预处理挑战，尤其是在跨领域的高性能计算环境中。

Method: 方法包括分析四个典型领域的工作流程，并提出一个结合数据准备级别和处理阶段的两维框架。

Result: 结果是一个概念性的成熟度矩阵，用于评估科学数据的准备状态，并指导基础设施开发。

Conclusion: 结论强调了标准化和跨领域支持对可扩展和可重复的科学AI的重要性。

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在提升推理能力的同时会加剧社会偏见。通过比较三种去偏策略（SFT、KD、RL），发现1:4的混合训练比例能在减少10%偏见的同时保留88%的推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力提升与社会偏见缓解之间的权衡关系，为MLLMs的公平性和能力平衡提供指导。

Method: 比较三种去偏策略（SFT、KD、RL），并通过调整去偏与推理样本比例，分析其对偏见和推理能力的影响。

Result: 1:4的混合训练比例（RL）能减少10%偏见，同时保留88%的推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为MLLMs的公平性与能力平衡提供了具体方案，表明推理与偏见缓解并非完全对立。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上表现极差，失败率高达93%。研究通过听觉图灵测试揭示了AI在选择性注意力、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 设计了包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，涵盖七类任务，评估了包括GPT-4和Whisper在内的先进音频模型。

Result: AI模型平均准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%，暴露了其在复杂听觉场景处理中的缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究为迈向人类水平机器听觉提供了诊断框架，并强调需要整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出并形式化定义了‘论证一致性’属性，要求预测者的推理与预测一致。通过实验验证，过滤不一致预测能提高人类和LLM预测的准确性，但用户实验显示用户通常不遵循这一属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证一致性在判断性预测中的价值，尤其是在人类和LLM预测中。

Method: 形式化定义论证一致性，并通过实验评估其对人类和LLM预测的影响，以及用户对其的认知。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高了预测准确性，但用户通常不遵循一致性。

Conclusion: 论证一致性对预测准确性有实际价值，需在群体预测中引入机制过滤不一致意见。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中各事实的贡献，以理解责任度量的计算复杂度。

Method: 利用数据库设置的结果，分析WSMS在不同查询类和ontology语言中的计算复杂度。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询类，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂度；对于某些ontology语言，问题为shP-hard。

Conclusion: 在DL-Lite方言中，通过限制查询结构，可以实现高效的WSMS计算。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分治法的混合MILP方法，通过SAS评分选择关键ReLU变量，显著减少了二进制变量数量，提高了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法效率低下，需要优化ReLU变量的选择以减少计算成本。

Method: 结合分治法，提出SAS评分和全局评分（GS）选择关键ReLU变量，并采用混合MILP方法（先调用α,β-CROWN，再调用部分MILP）。

Result: SAS评分将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，同时保持准确性；混合MILP方法将未决实例减少40%，运行时间合理。

Conclusion: SAS评分和混合MILP方法显著提升了验证效率，适用于大规模CNN。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway

we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果推断是大型语言模型的核心挑战之一，传统模型在数据扰动下表现不佳，因此研究推理模型在因果发现任务中的鲁棒性具有重要意义。

Method: 使用Corr2Cause基准测试，比较推理模型与传统方法的性能，并设计了一种基于Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts的模块化上下文管道。

Result: 推理模型在因果发现任务中表现显著优于传统方法，模块化管道进一步将性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 尽管高级推理模型在因果发现中表现出色，但结构化上下文框架对其性能最大化至关重要，并为跨领域因果发现提供了通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释方法缺乏形式严谨性，而逻辑解释虽严谨但假设过强。

Method: 引入因果解释，证明其形式性质，并提出对比性和置信度感知的完整因果解释。

Result: 实验显示不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上有不同模式，算法高效且黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习（ICL）的代理在复杂推理和工具使用任务中表现良好，但示例选择对性能影响显著，缺乏通用且理论支持的选择标准。

Conclusion: DICE强调了基于原则和上下文感知的示例选择对提升代理性能的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Conclusion: 提出的Recall Router框架和MemoCue代理在记忆回忆应用中表现出色，解决了策略选择和响应生成的关键挑战。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAR的个性化问题推荐方法，通过将协作思想融入探索机制，解决了传统强化学习方法在训练中探索效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将个性化问题推荐建模为马尔可夫决策过程并使用强化学习解决，但存在探索效率低的问题，无法在训练中为每个学生找到最佳问题。

Method: 提出了Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR)，将协作思想融入探索机制，从而在有限的训练轮次内实现更高效的探索。

Result: 实验表明，RAR显著提升了推荐性能，且该框架可应用于任何基于强化学习的问题推荐系统。

Conclusion: RAR通过改进探索机制，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为个性化问题推荐提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in
https://github.com/wuming29/RAR.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估AI代理在探索性环境中的自主能力，因此需要一种更全面的测试方法。

Method: 利用Infocom互动小说游戏作为测试环境，要求AI代理在不使用外部工具的情况下进行长上下文推理和问题解决。

Result: TextQuests提供了一个专注于内在推理能力的基准测试，适用于评估AI代理在复杂、探索性环境中的表现。

Conclusion: TextQuests填补了现有基准测试的不足，为开发更强大的AI代理提供了新的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: Seed-Prover是一种基于强化学习和形式化验证的定理证明模型，通过迭代优化证明过程，显著提升了数学推理能力，尤其在IMO级问题上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在数学定理证明中因缺乏明确的监督信号而表现不佳，形式化验证语言（如Lean）提供了清晰的监督信号。

Method: 提出Seed-Prover模型，结合Lean的反馈、已证明引理和自我总结，迭代优化证明；并设计三种推理策略以解决IMO级问题。

Result: Seed-Prover在形式化IMO问题中达到78.1%的证明率，显著优于先前方法；并开发了Seed-Geometry引擎以支持几何推理。

Conclusion: Seed-Prover和Seed-Geometry展示了形式化验证与长链推理的有效结合，推动了自动数学推理的进展。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.
