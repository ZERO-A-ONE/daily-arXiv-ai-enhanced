In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference\non encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network\n(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our\napproach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to\nprotect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We\nevaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and\nLIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage\nefficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the\nencrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted\ncounterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The\nproposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,\noffering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics."}

We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences.

Prior studies on privacy-preserving graph data\npublishing relied on heuristic graph modification strategies and it is\ndifficult to determine the graph with the optimal privacy--utility trade-off\nfor publishing. In contrast, we propose the first privacy-preserving graph\nstructure learning framework against sensitive link inference attacks, named\nPPGSL, which can automatically learn a graph with the optimal privacy--utility\ntrade-off. The PPGSL operates by first simulating a powerful surrogate attacker\nconducting sensitive link attacks on a given graph. It then trains a\nparameterized graph to defend against the simulated adversarial attacks while\nmaintaining the favorable utility of the original graph. To learn the\nparameters of both parts of the PPGSL, we introduce a secure iterative training\nprotocol. It can enhance privacy preservation and ensure stable convergence\nduring the training process, as supported by the theoretical proof.\nAdditionally, we incorporate multiple acceleration techniques to improve the\nefficiency of the PPGSL in handling large-scale graphs. The experimental\nresults confirm that the PPGSL achieves state-of-the-art privacy--utility\ntrade-off performance and effectively thwarts various sensitive link inference\nattacks."}

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that\nEvo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only\ndecoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.\nWe present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the\ncontributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a\nnew paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths\nof symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution."}

To facilitate a\nhuman-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on\nindividuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the\nexplanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to\nexplanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based\non what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's\nworldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous\ninteractions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can\nestimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user."}

Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker.

Departing from the traditional\ntask-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based\nmethod, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,\nidentified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a\ngoal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of\nmultiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent\nbusiness process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and\nagents.

However, many methods treat LLMs as\nend-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and\nforces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,\nmethods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent\nspace frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to\ntreat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules\nwithin a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that\nprovides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to\nrefine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we\nintroduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend\npatterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,\nrather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the\nlatent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly\nmodels inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.\nExperiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG\nconsistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value\nof explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance."}
