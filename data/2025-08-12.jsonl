This\npaper presents an empirical study of patch integration failures in 14 divergent\npair of variants and introduces RePatch, a refactoring-aware integration system\nfor Java repositories. RePatch extends the RefMerge framework, originally\ndesigned for symmetric merges, by supporting asymmetric patch transfer.

Early approaches in code\ntranslation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited\ncoverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the\ntask as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code\nblocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and\nmaintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct\nprompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the\nsyntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it\ndifficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To\naddress these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that\nIntegrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three\nmodules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation\nexamples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us,\nthereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization\nmodule that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the\nsemantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that\nleverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations.

The inherent\ncomplexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of\nexisting transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the\napplicability of formal verification to Python programs.\n  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed\nby bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated\nC code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code\nusing existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two\nPython benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high\ndegree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development\nenvironment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault\ndiagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs."}

While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape\npremature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued\nproblems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three\nfactors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,\nover-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty\naccumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we\npropose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs\nthat incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize\nconstraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the\nmagnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty\nupdates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents\nplay a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various\nstandard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high\ndamping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance\non general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins\n(\\textbf{3.77\\%--66.3\\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results."}

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values.

These codebase\nAI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to\nfocus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has\nextensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class\nof codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial\nanecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently\nadopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we\nneed to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall\nshort of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a\ncounterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers\nworking on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the\ninformation in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),\nrequired functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and\ntheir prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall\nsatisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =\n3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most\ncommon factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code\nquality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We\ndelve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying\nchallenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers\nto incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial\nCBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present\ndesign opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs."}

In contrast, programmers working\nin languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,\nwhich enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent\ncomplexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of\nexisting transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the\napplicability of formal verification to Python programs.\n  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed\nby bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated\nC code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code\nusing existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two\nPython benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high\ndegree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development\nenvironment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault\ndiagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs."}
