Architectural patterns and\nstrategies can provide reusable knowledge and best practices to engineer\nquantum software systems effectively and efficiently. However, quantum software\npractitioners face significant challenges in selecting and implementing\nappropriate patterns and strategies due to the complexity of quantum software\nsystems and the lack of guidelines. To address these challenges, this study\nproposes decision models for selecting patterns and strategies in six critical\ndesign areas in quantum software systems: Communication, Decomposition, Data\nProcessing, Fault Tolerance, Integration and Optimization, and Algorithm\nImplementation. These decision models are constructed based on data collected\nfrom both a mining study (i.e., GitHub and Stack Exchange) and a Systematic\nLiterature Review, which were used to identify relevant patterns and strategies\nwith their involved Quality Attributes (QAs). We then conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with 16 quantum software practitioners to evaluate the familiarity,\nunderstandability, completeness, and usefulness of the proposed decision\nmodels. The results show that the proposed decision models can aid\npractitioners in selecting suitable patterns and strategies to address the\nchallenges related to the architecture design of quantum software systems.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u540c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u2019\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5316\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u63a5\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\u6269\u5c55AI\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u63a5\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08SGV\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "SGV\u4f7fMLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe20\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u540c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors.

Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the\npotential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges\ndue to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of\ntraining data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations.

In particular, honeybees mainly\nuse the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their\nvisual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a\nReinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only\noptic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained\nagents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base\ntheir motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most\nattention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with\nlarge optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered\ntunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while\nmaintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the\nbehavior seen in flying insects.

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The\nfirst technique is a template representation transformation that sharply\nreduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient\nencoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving\nthe number of operations on encrypted templates.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Unfortunately, each new\nisolation boundary adds ad-hoc access control mechanisms, hardware extensions,\nand trusted software. This escalating complexity bloats the TCB, complicates\nend-to-end attestation, and leads to fragmentation across platforms and cloud\nservice providers (CSPs).\n  We introduce a unified isolation model that delegates enforceable,\ncomposable, and attestable isolation to a single trusted security monitor:\nTyche. Tyche provides an API for partitioning, sharing, attesting, and\nreclaiming resources through its core abstraction, trust domains (TDs). To\nprovide fine-grain isolation, TDs can recursively create and manage sub-TDs.\nTyche captures these relationships in attestations, allowing cloud tenants to\nreason about end-to-end security. TDs serve as the building blocks for\nconstructing composable enclaves, sandboxes, and CVMs.\n  Tyche runs on commodity x86_64 without hardware security extensions and can\nmaintain backward compatibility with existing software. We provide an SDK to\nrun and compose unmodified workloads as sandboxes, enclaves, and CVMs with\nminimal overhead compared to native Linux execution. Tyche supports complex\ncloud scenarios, such as confidential inference with mutually distrustful\nusers, model owners, and CSPs.

These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the\nsigning key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed.\nWhile such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may\nbe possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle.\nOSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in\ndecentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical\ncommunication. OSS are also closely related to separations between\nclassical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and\ncommitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al.\nwas only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their\njustification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence\nof OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open.\n  We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming\n(sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also\ngives the first standard-model separation between classical and\ncollapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open\nproblem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional\nsecurity relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model\nconstruction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations\n(permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs\ninvolving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs.
