However, this integration also\nintroduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal\njailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods,\nincluding Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety\nTuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs'\nbuilt-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of\nmultimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger\njailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven\nmultimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing\nheavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive\nanalysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in\nMLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers\nare responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of\nprecisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety\ntuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by\nthis, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense\nframework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while\nrestoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs\nwhile preserving efficiency.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively.

Therefore, in our research, we proposed a\nhierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and\nthe reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally\nreasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.\nOur work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement\nfine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in\nBamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding\nSearch-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6Agent-as-tool\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6a21\u578b\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6Agent-as-tool\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728180\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0cBamboogle\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We consider a brick-and-mortar retail\nsetting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive\nonline orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival\nof orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery\noffers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming\n(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network\n(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nintegrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost\nefficiency, with up to 6.7\\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and\napproximately 18\\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible\ndelivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces\noperational costs by 8\\% and 17\\%, respectively.

Previous to our research, food crystals\nin the images were manually counted, which required substantial and\ntime-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal\nanalysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool\nenables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers\nfrom microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample\npreparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high\nresolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also\ndeveloped to aid in these efforts.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u6709\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u539f\u5219\u6765\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b2) \u6539\u8fdbGelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u652f\u6301\u6027\u3001\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5426\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5426\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff1b3) \u6269\u5c55\u652f\u6301\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b4) \u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b5) \u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b6) \u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9884\u671f\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Gelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5408\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}
