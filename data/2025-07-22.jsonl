According to the widely\nadopted testing pyramid, unit tests constitute the majority of test cases and\nare often schematic, requiring minimal domain expertise. Automatically\ngenerating such tests under the supervision of software engineers can\nsignificantly enhance productivity during the development phase of the software\nlifecycle.\n  This paper investigates the impact of code context and prompting strategies\non the quality and adequacy of unit tests generated by various large language\nmodels (LLMs) across several families. The results show that including\ndocstrings notably improves code adequacy, while further extending context to\nthe full implementation yields definitely smaller gains. Notably, the\nchain-of-thought prompting strategy -- applied even to 'reasoning' models --\nachieves the best results, with up to 96.3\\% branch coverage, a 57\\% average\nmutation score, and near-perfect compilation success rate.

It\ninvolves breaking down the input into units that are later passed to the\nlanguage model stack to learn high-dimensional representations used in various\ncontexts, from classification to generation. However, the output of these\ntokenizers is often longer than that traditionally used in compilers and\ninterpreters. This could result in undesirable effects, such as increased\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the\nhidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such\nas subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one\nbased on averaging the representations and another that leverages a\nlearning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language\nmodels for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M),\nand CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability\ndetection, code classification, and code translation.

This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process.

We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:\nmisinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that\ndecentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than\ncentralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them\nto adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional\ninterventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can\nadjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these\nmalicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and\ncountermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent."}

However, despite its remarkable capabilities and\nthe substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still\nhas some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This\ndesign maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention.\nSpecifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and\npopping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an\nend-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both\nChomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse\ntasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and\nother baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B\nparameters.

Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt\noptimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates\ncompared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while\nusing only a small number of tokens (<=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix.\nFurthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy,\nvalidated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative\nlog-likelihood with Welch's t-test.

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort.

However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to\nride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to\neliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired\nby GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO\nframework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,\nthe optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we\nterm One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO).

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far.

However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the\nquality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two\nfundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct\nchecks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as\nassertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much\nprogress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic\nexecution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored\nproblem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of\nexpected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not\nexist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.\n  Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely\nused Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is\nthat Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated\ngeneration of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly\ndetailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how\nthe libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large\nlanguage models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a\nframework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and\nexceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being\ncompilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the\nfew incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the\nhelp of additional comment information generated by the LLMs."}

Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal\ndecrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to\nscalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions\nfor the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation. SimdBench is fully open source at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader\nresearch community."}

However, despite its remarkable capabilities and\nthe substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still\nhas some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This\ndesign maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention.\nSpecifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and\npopping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an\nend-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both\nChomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse\ntasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and\nother baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B\nparameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M\noutperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters,\nshowcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability."}

Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional\nrule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms\nrace between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs)\nfurther exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing\nphishing emails at minimal cost.\n  This work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive\nphishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all\ncommercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose\nPiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages\nknowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails\noften contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts.\nPiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an\nemail, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the\nlegitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and\n(iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory\nclaims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable\nexplanations.\n  Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector,\nPiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks\nlike Nazario and PhishPot. In a real-world evaluation of 10,183 emails across\nfive university accounts over three years, PiMRef achieved 92.1% precision,\n87.9% recall, and a median runtime of 0.05s, outperforming the state-of-the-art\nin both effectiveness and efficiency."}

One critical threat is\nprompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts\nto gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise\nLLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses\nmild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM\nintegrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for\nthese multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory,\noptimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks\nare shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context\n(e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety\nmeasures are in place.\n  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including\nstatistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization\ntechniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is\nsupported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we\nderive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training\nand demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with\nhigh AUC. We also introduce an approach called \"spotlighting\" that uses input\ntransformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by\nan order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and\nempirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work\nhighlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond\nsingle-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both\nattacks and defenses."}

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source\ntext-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12\nbillion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises\nconcerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.\n  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the\nenvironment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to\nenhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.\n  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters\nand prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated\nimages while also lowering the energy consumption required for image\ngeneration. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to\nthat of the original SD model.\n  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion,\ntesting it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our\nresults demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%,\nethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and\nGPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are\nconsistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.\n  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social\nand environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible\nwithout fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture."}
