While\nrecent studies have focused on increasing the accuracy and scalability of MAD\nsystems, their security vulnerabilities have received limited attention. In\nthis work, we introduce MAD-Spear, a targeted prompt injection attack that\ncompromises a small subset of agents but significantly disrupts the overall MAD\nprocess. Manipulated agents produce multiple plausible yet incorrect responses,\nexploiting LLMs' conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation and degrade\nconsensus quality. Furthermore, the attack can be composed with other\nstrategies, such as communication attacks, to further amplify its impact by\nincreasing the exposure of agents to incorrect responses. To assess MAD's\nresilience under attack, we propose a formal definition of MAD fault-tolerance\nand develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that jointly considers\naccuracy, consensus efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels demonstrate that MAD-Spear\nconsistently outperforms the baseline attack in degrading system performance.\nAdditionally, we observe that agent diversity substantially improves MAD\nperformance in mathematical reasoning tasks, which challenges prior work\nsuggesting that agent diversity has minimal impact on performance.

It involves\ncollaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address\npotential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,\nmulti-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.\nHowever, existing research provides limited support for requirements\ndevelopment and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the\nhuman-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,\nnamed iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents\nto support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform\nvarious tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses\non integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world\nstakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an\nartifact pool.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a\nprincipled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical\nreasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVAR-MATH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793aRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u57fa\u51c6\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VAR-MATH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aRL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08AMC23\u4e0b\u964d48.0%\uff0cAIME24\u4e0b\u964d58.3%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "VAR-MATH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We\nillustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous\npublic bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally\nsalient contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9053\u5fb7\u4ee3\u7406\uff08AMA\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfcAMA\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5341\u9879\u529f\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5982\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u516c\u4ea4\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u8ba2\u6807\u51c6\u4e3aLLM-based AMA\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9053\u5fb7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eLLM-based AMA\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u540e\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u6e90\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u7531\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6392\u540d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u540e\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002"}}
