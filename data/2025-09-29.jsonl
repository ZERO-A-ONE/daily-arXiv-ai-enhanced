While recent LLM-based and\nLLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale\nrepositories due to concern mixing, where relevant logic is buried in large\nfunctions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across\nfiles.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that\nabstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens\ndecomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level\nconcerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It\noperates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual\nknowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that\nretrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and\nintegrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt\nenhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks\nderived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art\ntools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains\nof over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level\nlocalization.

To this end, we propose\nSysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation\nvectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities.\nRemarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the\nmodel's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves\nthe LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in\nlong-context scenarios."}

Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the\nQwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its\nself-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the\nexplorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling\nparadigm.

GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module\nthat abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning\nmodule that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and\n(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary\nlines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed\nloop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement\nlearning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic\nexploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a\nhigh-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or\naffine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that\nGeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and\nproblem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying\nhierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic\nverification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static\ninterpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new\nfoundation for solving complex visuospatial problems."}

This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the\neffective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a\ngiven task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation\nof each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors\ndistance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,\nthereby providing a unified failure signal.

Results show that (i) current agents\nstruggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent\nsupported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,\n(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce\nvulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding\nexplicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure\ncoding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish\nSecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step\ntoward more reliable software development with LLMs."}

However, due to LLMs' inherent uncertainty issues,\ngranting agents control over computers poses significant security risks. When\nagent actions deviate from user intentions, they can cause irreversible\nconsequences. Existing mitigation approaches, such as user confirmation and\nLLM-based dynamic action validation, still suffer from limitations in\nusability, security, and performance. To address these challenges, we propose\nCSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for\ncomputer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic\ncontext and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies,\nand provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and\nrefining them. CSAgent enforces these policies through an optimized OS service,\nensuring that agent actions can only be executed under specific user intents\nand contexts. CSAgent supports protecting agents that control computers through\ndiverse interfaces, including API, CLI, and GUI. We implement and evaluate\nCSAgent, which successfully defends against more than 99.36% of attacks while\nintroducing only 6.83% performance overhead."}

This paper explores the\nintersection of geopolitical dynamics, cyber threat intelligence analysis, and\nadvanced detection technologies, with a focus on the energy domain. We leverage\ngenerative artificial intelligence to extract and structure information from\nraw cyber threat descriptions, enabling enhanced analysis. By conducting a\ngeopolitical comparison of threat actor origins and target regions across\nmultiple databases, we provide insights into trends within the general threat\nlandscape. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of cybersecurity tools\n-- with particular emphasis on learning-based techniques -- in detecting\nindicators of compromise for energy-targeted attacks. This analysis yields new\ninsights, providing actionable information to researchers, policy makers, and\ncybersecurity professionals."}
