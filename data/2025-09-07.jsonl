Davis", "Antonio Bianchi", "Aravind Machiry"], "title": "Reactive Bottom-Up Testing", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers\napply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most\ncommon and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a\ntop-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the\ncall graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address\nthese limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating\nvalid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.\n  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up\nTesting. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not\nsufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is\na systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also\nvalidates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that\ndetected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a\nthree-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions\nand generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and\nextract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by\ncombining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated\nprototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting\nusing a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,\nwhere we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we\nevaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it\ndiscovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that\nReactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of\nvulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security\npractices."}

Traditional Intrusion\nDetection Systems (IDS) often fail to meet the stringent requirements of\nresource-constrained IoT environments due to their high computational cost and\nreliance on large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel hybrid Intrusion Detection System that integrates a Quantum\nGenetic Algorithm (QGA) with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The QGA leverages\nquantum-inspired evolutionary operators to optimize feature selection and\nfine-tune model parameters, ensuring lightweight yet efficient detection in\nresource-limited networks. Meanwhile, SSL enables the system to learn robust\nrepresentations from unlabeled data, thereby reducing dependency on manually\nlabeled training sets.

In response, we propose BIDO, a\nhybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both\nobfuscation and concept drift simultaneously.

FaaSGuard\nsystematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage\nof the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and\nmonitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded\nsecrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through\na case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub\nrepositories.

In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs\nreflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.\nThis approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for\nnew resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.\nKubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,\ndevelopers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security.

In response, we propose BIDO, a\nhybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both\nobfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the\ndiscriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection\nmodule that identifies informative subregions within malware images.

However, current\nmedical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking\ntransparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which\nhinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce\nDeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It\nleverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR\ninstruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,\nthen exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start\nreasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance\nboth grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model\nproduces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions\nfor each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements\nin report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and\nvisual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)\ntasks.

However, these datasets primarily focus on\nassessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the\nmore complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an\nincomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.\nWhile several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer\nfrom limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error\ntypes. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a\nmulti-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22\nsubtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3\ndebugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,\nwhere Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well\nin repository-level debugging."}

Python packages, as units\nof organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,\nhighlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting\nlanguage, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or\ninteroperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to\nPython packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools\nremains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.\nPyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,\neach linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection\ntechniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An\nLLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,\nachieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul\nas the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further\ncarry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that\nvulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and\nexhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nmulti-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to\nvulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark\nreveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools\nand the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python\npackages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs\nobserved in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of\ncurrent detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in\nthe field."}
