Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into\nfixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.\nFurthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that\neven a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output\nanimation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these\nobstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient\nmulti-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus\ncreating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text\ninput.

In higher-order uncoupled\nlearning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)\nbut are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information\n(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback\nstabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that\nfor any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist\nhigher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We\nfurther establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking\nlearning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We\nconstruct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the\ncompletely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the\ncompletely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural\nrestrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best\nResponse (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a\nbest response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that\nthe ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order\nlearning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the\nABR property.

Yet, despite recent advances,\ntheir output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains\ndifficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nresearchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,\nsuch as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\nIn this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that\nharnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving\naccuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of\ndecompiled code: \\textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.\nCentral to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system\nto score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,\nD-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher\nscores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,\nD-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler\nand symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then\nevaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with\nthe original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for\nfine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,\ndemonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the\ncoreutils and util-linux projects.

KLJN has the potential to\nrevolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of\nsimplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security.\nUnlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and\nexpensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links,\nKLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly\nreducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded\nin the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental\nand radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions\nof satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to\nintegrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a\nrevolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient\nsatellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving\nunconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks\nwhich address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats,\nincluding quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to\nunconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential\nuse of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for\nsecurity, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental\nsensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles\nto provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative,\nparticularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers\nsignificant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making\nit a practical choice for many secure communication applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "KLJN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08QKD\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4QKD\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7535\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\u548c\u7535\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0KLJN\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "KLJN\u5728\u6210\u672c\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eQKD\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "KLJN\u662f\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u9769\u547d\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However,\nthe increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,\nwhich may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result\nin significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is\nfundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective\ndebugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale\nempirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed\ntraining/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We\nexamine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and\ncommon low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of\nthese frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy\nerror and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs\nremains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and\nroot causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component\ninteractions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal\ncode changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic\noptimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility\nhandling, indicating potential for automation.

Dynamically selecting the\noptimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a\npromising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and\nperformance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive\nand often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on\nhuman-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in\nreal-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task\ndifficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that\ndynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically\nassessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using\nChain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into\nthree difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed\ndifficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best\nmodel for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental\nresults show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score\nwhile reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method\nComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an\napproximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of\ncost consumption.

Unlike previous removal attacks, which\nrely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only\nrequires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the\ntarget diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By\nleveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the\nmodel's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based\nattacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction\nin the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to\n0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image\nquality.

Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,\nand physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of\nheterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances\nin high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in\ndiverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for\nautomated and comparative evaluation.\n  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation\nsupport, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are\nconfigured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation\ncomponents are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly\ncompose systems or integrate components across platforms.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based\nsimulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure\nsimulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed,\ncomponent-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and\nreconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim\nthrough case studies that include co-simulations involving custom\nautomaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf\nplatforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics.

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00.

In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI\nand DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than\noriginal SBD, which failed to attack at all.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Multi-Element (ME)\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSBD\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165DCT\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eSBD\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SBD\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6837\u672c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faME\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165DCT\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCIR/FAE\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523016.78%/39.50\u548c51.20%/23.60\uff0c\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eSBD\u3002", "conclusion": "ME\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7248\u6743\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The\nchallenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only\ndetect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,\nleaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of\nseemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor\nthat observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%\nattack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition\nattack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be\ninjected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.\nTo defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring\nframework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully\nprompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,\nbeating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust\nagainst random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our\nfindings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in\nmitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6076\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u88ab\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u826f\u6027\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed5\u8fc7\u62d2\u7edd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6d45\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5373\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u957f\u7a0b\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u5206\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u957f\u7a0b\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u987a\u5e8f\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1\u5206\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe93%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e90%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c1150%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u987a\u5e8f\u76d1\u63a7\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u5206\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}
