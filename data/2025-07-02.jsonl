We introduce MultiCodeIF, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate instruction-following in code generation across multiple\ndimensions: constraint type, hierarchical levels, and iterative refinement.\nBuilt upon a structured taxonomy of 9 categories and 27 constraint types,\nMultiCodeIF enables granular assessment of both functional and non-functional\ninstruction adherence. Using an automated pipeline, ConstraGen, we synthesize\nand evolve 2,021 code tasks sourced from 14 programming languages, supporting\nmulti-turn evaluation through feedback-driven task variants. Empirical\nevaluation of six state-of-the-art LLMs uncovers substantial performance\ndisparities. The top-performing model, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, achieves 63.0%\naverage constraint satisfaction, while smaller models like Qwen3-1.7B fall to\n44.8%. Models perform well on explicit constraints, but struggle with implicit\nor abstract constraints. Tasks with multiple hierarchical constraints\nsignificantly reduce model success rates, from 54.5% in single-level to just\n18.8% in multi-level scenarios. However, structured feedback enables\nprogressive improvement: average constraint satisfaction rises from 63.0% to\n83.4% over four iterative refinement rounds. MultiCodeIF provides a scalable,\nconstraint-aware, and feedback-sensitive framework to benchmark LLMs under\nrealistic code generation scenarios, bridging the gap between synthetic\nevaluations and real-world instruction complexity.

However, its communication protocols, including Sampled\nValues (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and\nencryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber\nattacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker\noperations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in\ndigital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because\nof the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes\na novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection,\nprevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The\nmethod uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model\ncommunication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent\nneural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability\ndistributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal\nprocessing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication\nnetwork latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a\nnear-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation\nis conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices,\nhardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices\nand merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks.

This paper investigates the\nsusceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel\nbackdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed\nBadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency\nsensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed\ntriggers.

The security of Bluetooth relies on\nthe pairing process, where devices establish shared long-term keys for secure\ncommunications. However, many commercial Bluetooth devices implement automatic\npairing functions to improve user convenience, creating a previously unexplored\nattack surface.\n  We present Stealtooth, a novel attack that abuses unknown vulnerabilities in\nthe automatic pairing functions in commercial Bluetooth devices to achieve\ncompletely silent device link key overwriting. The Stealtooth attack leverages\nthe fact that Bluetooth audio devices automatically transition to pairing mode\nunder specific conditions, enabling attackers to hijack pairing processes\nwithout user awareness or specialized tools. We also extend the attack into the\nMitM Stealtooth attack, combining automatic pairing abuse with power-saving\nmode techniques to enable man-in-the-middle attacks.\n  We evaluate the attacks against 10 commercial Bluetooth devices from major\nmanufacturers, demonstrating widespread vulnerabilities across diverse device\ntypes and manufacturers. Our practical implementation requires only commodity\nhardware and open-source software, highlighting the low barrier to entry for\nattackers.\n  We propose defenses both device and protocol levels, including enhanced user\nnotifications and standardized automatic pairing guidelines.

But as math leaderboards improve week by week,\nit is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or\njust narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure.
