While Tor encrypts traffic and hides\nIP addresses, it remains vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as the\nwebsite fingerprinting (WF) attack, achieving increasingly high fingerprinting\naccuracy even under open-world conditions. In response, researchers have\nproposed a variety of defenses, ranging from adaptive padding, traffic\nregularization, and traffic morphing to adversarial perturbation, that seek to\nobfuscate or reshape traffic traces. However, these defenses often entail\ntrade-offs between privacy, usability, and system performance. Despite\nextensive research, a comprehensive survey unifying WF datasets, attack\nmethodologies, and defense strategies remains absent. This paper fills that gap\nby systematically categorizing existing WF research into three key domains:\ndatasets, attack models, and defense mechanisms. We provide an in-depth\ncomparative analysis of techniques, highlight their strengths and limitations\nunder diverse threat models, and discuss emerging challenges such as multi-tab\nbrowsing and coarse-grained traffic features. By consolidating prior work and\nidentifying open research directions, this survey serves as a foundation for\nadvancing stronger privacy protection in Tor."}

While\nnumerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in\nselecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as\nwell as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies\nacross isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small\nnumber of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to\nlower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that\nsimplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.\n  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we\nintroduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red\nteaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)\nmodels. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that\nbundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security\ntesting, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup,\ninitiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container,\neither locally or using a cloud platform.

Large language models\n(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations\nthrough natural language requests (e.g., \"I want to see respectful posts with a\ndifferent perspective than mine\"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows\nfor natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time\nwith computational efficiency.

Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models\n(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its\nperformance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier\nLLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two\nLean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum\ntheory.

Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations\nrevealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%\nof the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered\nassistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end\nlifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that\nautomatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a\nnovel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank\nrefactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,\nprojectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing\nrefactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,\nsynergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and\nsemantic relevance.

While\nnumerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in\nselecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as\nwell as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies\nacross isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small\nnumber of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to\nlower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that\nsimplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.\n  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we\nintroduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red\nteaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)\nmodels.

This paper proposes Countermind, a\nmulti-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,\npost hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement\nmodel. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally\nvalidate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism\nintended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output\nis generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs\nfor: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text\nCrypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,\nprovided all ingestion paths are enforced.

With the\nnatural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which\ncalls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several\nearly efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they\nadopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without\nleveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,\nlacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict\nevaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require\nreasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the\nfirst benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source\nCTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,\nstructured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that\ncapture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations.

Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at\ngenerating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the\ngenerated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from\ncorrect behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional\ncontracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions\nalone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally\nalign well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software\nverifiers to catch real-world bugs."}
