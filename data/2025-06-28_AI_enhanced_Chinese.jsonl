However,\ntoday, it is difficult for operators to experiment, explore, and evaluate\ndeception approaches. Existing tools and platforms have non-portable and\ncomplex implementations that are difficult to modify and extend. We address\nthis pain point by introducing Perry, a high-level framework that accelerates\nthe design and exploration of deception what-if scenarios. Perry has two\ncomponents: a high-level abstraction layer for security operators to specify\nattackers and deception strategies, and an experimentation module to run these\nattackers and defenders in realistic emulated networks. To translate these\nhigh-level specifications we design four key modules for Perry: 1) an action\nplanner that translates high-level actions into low-level implementations, 2)\nan observability module to translate low-level telemetry into high-level\nobservations, 3) an environment state service that enables environment agnostic\nstrategies, and 4) an attack graph service to reason about how attackers could\nexplore an environment. We illustrate that Perry's abstractions reduce the\nimplementation effort of exploring a wide variety of deception defenses,\nattackers, and environments. We demonstrate the value of Perry by emulating 55\nunique deception what-if scenarios and illustrate how these experiments enable\noperators to shed light on subtle tradeoffs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Perry\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6b3a\u9a97\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6a21\u5757\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6b3a\u9a97\u9632\u5fa1\u5de5\u5177\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "Perry\u5305\u542b\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u56fe\u670d\u52a1\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u89c4\u8303\u5230\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "Perry\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6b3a\u9a97\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc755\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u573a\u666f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "Perry\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6b3a\u9a97\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u6743\u8861\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing backdoor strategies predominantly rely on end-to-end label\nsupervision, which, despite their efficacy, often results in detectable feature\ndisentanglement and limited persistence. In this work, we propose a novel and\nstealthy backdoor attack framework, named SPA, which fundamentally departs from\ntraditional approaches by leveraging feature-space alignment rather than direct\ntrigger-label association. Specifically, SPA reduces representational distances\nbetween backdoor trigger features and target class features, enabling the\nglobal model to misclassify trigger-embedded inputs with high stealth and\npersistence. We further introduce an adaptive, adversarial trigger optimization\nmechanism, utilizing boundary-search in the feature space to enhance attack\nlongevity and effectiveness, even against defensive FL scenarios and non-IID\ndata distributions. Extensive experiments on various FL benchmarks demonstrate\nthat SPA consistently achieves high attack success rates with minimal impact on\nmodel utility, maintains robustness under challenging participation and data\nheterogeneity conditions, and exhibits persistent backdoor effects far\nexceeding those of conventional techniques.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans.

Pertinent examples of\nsuch problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design\nspace exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often\ninfeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate\nthese issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial\nand error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL\nmethods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,\nhuman guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach\nand technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided\nby potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to\nbe mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal\nMT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,\nsubstantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient\ndevelopment of complex MTs.

We investigate four research questions assessing how\nprompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation\ncuration affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect\ndetection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security\nvs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting\nsignificantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,\nwith F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic\nEditing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,\ngreatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing\nperformance on others.

To facilitate effective alignment-driven\npretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of\n1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and\nindustry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining.

The\ngoal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at\nthe cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks\nto understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the\ncontext of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the\nstate of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray\nliterature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for\nhandcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated\nthe implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At\nthe studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to\nthe tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated\nfrontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other\nalternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable\nresults.
