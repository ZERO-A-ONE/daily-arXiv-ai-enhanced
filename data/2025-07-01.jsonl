However, the security implications of this setup\nremain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor\nattacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients\ninject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the\nglobal prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while\nstill maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this\nvulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters\npoisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained\noffline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client\ndata or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets.

These escalating trends underscore the urgent\nneed for effective approaches that can automatically detect and understand\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Objective: However, the scarcity of labeled samples\nand the class imbalance issue in vulnerability datasets present significant\nchallenges for both Vulnerability Type Prediction (VTP) and Line-level\nVulnerability Detection (LVD), especially for rare yet critical vulnerability\ntypes. Moreover, most existing studies treat VTP and LVD as independent tasks,\noverlooking their inherent correlation, which limits the potential to leverage\nshared semantic patterns across tasks. Methods: To address these limitations,\nwe propose a unified approach that integrates Embedding-Layer Driven\nAdversarial Training (EDAT) with Multi-task Learning (MTL). Specifically, EDAT\nenhances model robustness by introducing adversarial perturbations to\nidentifier embeddings, guided by semantic importance. Meanwhile, MTL improves\noverall performance by leveraging shared representations and inter-task\ncorrelations between VTP and LVD. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both VTP\nand LVD tasks. For VTP, it yields notable improvements in accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying rare vulnerability types.\nSimilarly, for LVD, our approach enhances line-level detection accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing false positives. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that\ncombining EDAT with MTL provides a unified solution that improves performance\non both tasks and warrants further investigation."}

To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing.

To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Benchmarking Robustness of Quantized LLMs in Code Generation", "comment": "13 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference\nwithout architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses\non evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original\ncounterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this\npaper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization\naffects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive\nexperiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and\nStarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate\nrobustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and\nnoise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional\nwisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness\ncompared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our\nadversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,\nour noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation\ngenerally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest\nthat quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually\nenhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights\nfor developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies."}

Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is\nhindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of\nthe privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset\nconsisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the\ngeneral release of such data to the public.\n  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API\noutputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and\nprovide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads\nAPIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a\nmethodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches\nthe re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of\ndifferential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of\nprivate user information from this release.\n  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of\ndifferentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over\ntime. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces\nand optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.\nFinally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.\n  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset\nobtained by this methodology.

However, existing\ntechniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV\nsettings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes\ncrucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding\ndeadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a\ncircular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.\nDespite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks\nremains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first\ndedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,\nSTCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs\ncontrolled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker\nconsists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and\nConflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable\nblack-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a\ngiven scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation\ncollaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial\nconflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive\nbehaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby\nincreasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We\nevaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,\na module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results\nshow that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing\nbaseline."}
