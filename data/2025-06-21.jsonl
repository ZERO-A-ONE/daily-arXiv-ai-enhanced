Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied\n(dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race\ndetection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not\nrelated by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race\nconsists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared\nchannel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific\nmessage from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can\nreceive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all.\nIn this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence\nof communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go\nprogramming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message\npassing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a\nhappens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels."}
