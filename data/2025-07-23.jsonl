The hierarchical structure of the multi-level finite state\nmachine enhances contract modularity and traceability, facilitating detailed\nrepresentation and evaluation of functional properties. The paper explores the\npotential of this multi-level approach, reviewing existing methodologies and\ntools, and detailing the smart contract generation process with an emphasis on\nreusable components and modularity. We also conduct a security analysis to\nevaluate potential vulnerabilities in our model, ensuring the robustness and\nreliability of the generated smart contracts."}

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale."}

To bridge this\ngap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to\nautomatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.\nUnlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly\nmodels the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic\nprompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and\ndiversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve\nthis without direct access to representative training samples, we draw\ninspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple\nand tractable objectives.

Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate\nfour practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion\nand draw conclusions for future mitigation design."}

This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "summary": "Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex\nnatural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate\nto an LLM the assessment of the \"quality\" of the output provided by an\nautomated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only\ntell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be\ntoo expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For\ncode summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by\nnine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our\nfindings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities\nfor both tasks, with \"smaller\" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not\nbeing able to cope with judging tasks.

In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).

This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract\nlatent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the\nsolution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start\nprocedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human\nreasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich\ninitialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical\nreasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework\nas a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and\ncontrol."}

Traditional automated\ntranslation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which\noften lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models\npresent promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based\nimplementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's\nautomated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,\nnarrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of\nclosed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the\neffectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a\nsecure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation\npipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in\ndeveloper acceleration."}

To bridge this\ngap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to\nautomatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.\nUnlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly\nmodels the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic\nprompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and\ndiversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve\nthis without direct access to representative training samples, we draw\ninspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple\nand tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient\noptimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long\nand potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is\nvalidated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I\nmodels and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity."}

Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate\nfour practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion\nand draw conclusions for future mitigation design."}

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been\nproposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,\ndesigning effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design\nchoices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java\nand Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore\nvarious RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their\neffectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,\nwe (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants\nto answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new\nquestions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the\nsimilarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding\npartially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find\nthat implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding\n(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering\nsimilarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG\npipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot\nperformance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline\nconsistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher\nscores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These\nfindings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer\nquality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen\nand novel questions across different LLMs"}

However,\ntraditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics,\nwhich can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to\nleverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs\ncan generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions,\npotentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches\nhave not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization\nmethods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we\nconducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of\nLLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex\ntiming logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL\noptimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a\nspecific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on\nmetamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL\ncode optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization\neffectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more\ncomplex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.\n(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic\noperations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL\noptimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods\non RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow\noptimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the\nchallenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these\nfindings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL\ncode optimization."}
