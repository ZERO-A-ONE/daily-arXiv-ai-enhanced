### [1] [How Software Engineers Engage with AI: A Pragmatic Process Model and Decision Framework Grounded in Industry Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17930)
*Vahid Garousi,Zafar Jafarov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI如何辅助软件工程，提出了一个过程模型和决策框架，帮助开发者权衡AI生成结果的效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI工具在软件工程中的实际应用，尤其是开发者如何信任、改进或拒绝AI生成的内容。

Method: 基于实践者报告和行业观察，提出过程模型和2D决策框架。

Result: 模型和框架为开发者提供了结构化指导，支持更有效的人机协作。

Conclusion: 研究为AI在软件工程中的实际应用提供了结构化方法，促进了人机协作的讨论。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文比较了11种自动化工具在9种严谨性标准上的表现，发现某些工具在特定标准（如开放数据检测）上表现优异，而工具组合在其他标准（如纳入排除标准检测）上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学报告缺乏标准化和透明度的问题，现有检查表（如ARRIVE和CONSORT）未被充分遵循，且同行评审常遗漏问题。

Method: 对11种自动化工具在9种严谨性标准上进行广泛比较。

Result: 某些工具在特定标准上表现突出，工具组合在某些标准上优于单一工具。

Conclusion: 提出了工具开发的改进方向，并为相关利益方提供了建议。代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data
for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.

### [3] [An Empirical Study of GenAI Adoption in Open-Source Game Development: Tools, Tasks, and Developer Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18029)
*Xiang Echo Chen,Wenhan Zhu,Guoshuai Albert Shi,Michael W. Godfrey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式AI（GenAI）在开源游戏开发中的应用，通过分析GitHub上的问题讨论，比较了GenAI与传统AI（TradAI）和非AI话题的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在游戏设计中的潜力尚未在开源社区中得到充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建开源游戏仓库的数据集，对GitHub问题进行开放卡片分类和主题分析，比较GenAI、TradAI和非AI话题的使用模式和挑战。

Result: 研究揭示了GenAI在开源游戏开发中的独特应用模式、开发者关注点及集成实践。

Conclusion: GenAI在游戏开发中的使用与传统AI和非AI方法有显著差异，为开发者提供了新的工具和挑战。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

### [4] [Your ATs to Ts: MITRE ATT&CK Attack Technique to P-SSCRM Task Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18037)
*Sivana Hamer,Jacob Bowen,Md Nazmul Haque,Chris Madden,Laurie Williams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文描述了MITRE ATT&CK攻击技术与P-SSCRM任务的映射，帮助软件组织识别任务如何缓解软件供应链攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过映射MITRE ATT&CK攻击技术与P-SSCRM任务，帮助软件组织更好地理解和应对供应链攻击。

Method: 采用四种独立策略确定一致的映射关系，并将P-SSCRM任务与10个框架的任务进行映射。

Result: 提供了MITRE ATT&CK与其他政府及行业框架之间的映射关系。

Conclusion: 该映射为软件组织提供了实用的工具，以识别和缓解供应链攻击风险。

Abstract: The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK)
Attack Technique to Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework
(P-SSCRM) Task mapping described in this document helps software organizations
to determine how different tasks mitigate the attack techniques of software
supply chain attacks. The mapping was created through four independent
strategies to find agreed-upon mappings. Because each P-SSCRM task is mapped to
one or more tasks from the 10 frameworks, the mapping we provide is also a
mapping between MITRE ATT&CK and other prominent government and industry
frameworks.

### [5] [Factors Impacting Faculty Adoption of Project-Based Learning in Computing Education: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18039)
*Ahmad D. Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了影响计算机教育工作者在软件工程和计算机课程中采用基于项目的学习（PjBL）的因素，揭示了采用不一致的原因及促进成功采用的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PjBL能提升学生多项能力，但教师采用率不高，研究旨在探索障碍及促进因素。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过在线调查收集80名教师的数据，结合定量统计和定性主题分析。

Result: PjBL虽受重视，但采用受限于规划、项目设计及缺乏支持；同行合作、专业发展和资源获取是关键促进因素。

Conclusion: 需系统性支持结构以帮助教师实验和扩展PjBL实践。

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

### [6] [An Empirical Study of Complexity, Heterogeneity, and Compliance of GitHub Actions Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18062)
*Edward Abrokwah,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了GitHub Actions（GHA）在开源项目中的使用情况，探讨了其工作流的复杂性、结构模式、最佳实践合规性以及不同编程语言间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GHA提供了官方文档和社区最佳实践，但缺乏对开源项目中实际工作流与这些实践对齐的实证研究。

Method: 通过分析Java、Python和C++仓库中的大量GHA工作流数据，研究其结构、复杂性和合规性。

Result: 预计发现最佳实践的遵循情况以及需要改进的领域，同时揭示不同语言的CI设计差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果将为CI服务提供改进建议，强调更清晰的指南和文档示例的必要性。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

### [7] [Identifier Name Similarities: An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18081)
*Carol Wong,Mai Abe,Silvia De Benedictis,Marissa Halim,Anthony Peruma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了标识符名称相似性对代码理解的影响，并提出了一个分类法来分类不同形式的名称相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标识符名称在代码理解中至关重要，但名称相似性可能导致误解，增加认知负担。

Method: 通过开发一个分类法，对标识符名称相似性进行分类。

Result: 初步提出了一个分类法，为研究者分析名称相似性对代码理解的影响提供了平台。

Conclusion: 分类法为未来研究提供了基础，可进一步扩展和优化。

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

### [8] [Understanding the Supply Chain and Risks of Large Language Model Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18105)
*Yujie Ma,Lili Quan,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Jiongchi Yu,Yao Zhang,Sen Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个全面的LLM供应链安全数据集，分析了3,859个真实应用，揭示了供应链中的依赖关系和风险，并提出了安全建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM系统的广泛应用，其复杂的供应链风险被忽视，缺乏系统性研究基准。

Method: 收集3,859个LLM应用，分析依赖关系（模型、数据集、库），并从漏洞数据库中提取1,555个风险问题。

Result: 发现LLM应用存在深层依赖关系和广泛漏洞，供应链安全风险显著。

Conclusion: 需全面安全分析，并提出实用建议以提高LLM系统的安全性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

### [9] [NoCode-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Natural Language-Driven Feature Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18130)
*Le Deng,Zhonghao Jiang,Jialun Cao,Michael Pradel,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NoCode-bench是一个评估LLMs在自然语言驱动无代码开发中表现的基准，包含634个任务，但最佳LLMs的任务成功率仅为15.79%，显示其尚不成熟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自然语言驱动无代码开发的潜力，利用LLMs实现软件功能的自然语言描述，以提高生产力和普及开发。

Method: 引入NoCode-bench基准，包含634个任务和114k代码变更，通过文档更新与代码实现的配对及开发者测试验证任务。

Result: 最佳LLMs的任务成功率为15.79%，暴露了跨文件编辑、代码库理解和工具调用等挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs目前无法完全支持自然语言驱动的无代码开发，NoCode-bench为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

TL;DR: SMECS工具通过从现有资源提取元数据并提供用户友好的界面，简化了研究软件的FAIR化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量元数据对FAIR原则的实施至关重要，但创建过程资源密集。

Method: 开发SMECS工具，从GitHub等在线仓库提取元数据，并提供交互界面供用户进一步编辑和导出为CodeMeta文件。

Result: 可用性实验证实SMECS提供满意的用户体验。

Conclusion: SMECS通过简化元数据创建，支持研究软件的FAIR化。

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

### [11] [GenAI for Automotive Software Development: From Requirements to Wheels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18223)
*Nenad Petrovic,Fengjunjie Pan,Vahid Zolfaghari,Krzysztof Lebioda,Andre Schamschurko,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GenAI的汽车软件自动化开发方法，重点针对自动驾驶和高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）。通过需求输入生成测试场景代码和ADAS功能实现，并利用模型驱动工程（MDE）检查需求一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在缩短ADAS相关功能的合规性和重新设计周期，减少开发和测试时间。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行需求建模（Ecore元模型、XMI模型实例和OCL约束创建）、测试场景生成、仿真代码（Python）和目标平台代码生成（C++）。采用检索增强生成（RAG）从自动驾驶法规文档中增强测试场景生成。

Result: 生成了测试场景代码和ADAS功能实现，并通过MDE检查需求一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缩短了ADAS开发的合规性和测试周期，提高了开发效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

### [12] [An Empirical Study on Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robot (EAIR) Software Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18267)
*Zeqin Liao,Zibin Zheng,Peifan Reng,Henglong Liang,Zixu Gao,Zhixiang Chen,Wei Li,Yuhong Nan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了885个EAIR系统错误，分类了18种根本原因、15种症状和13个受影响模块，揭示了EAIR特有的错误特征，并提出了模块与错误类型的映射关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EAIR系统错误的普遍性和特殊性缺乏深入理解，阻碍了相关技术和实践的发展。

Method: 通过分析80个EAIR项目中的885个错误，分类症状、原因和模块分布。

Result: 发现8种EAIR特有症状和8种特有原因，多数源于AI代理的推理和决策问题，并建立了模块与错误类型的映射。

Conclusion: 研究为EAIR系统错误的预测、检测和修复提供了重要参考，有助于未来研究聚焦于易受影响的模块。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

*Yan Li,Wenzhang Yang,Yuekun Wang,Jian Gao,Shaohua Wang,Yinxing Xue,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Scheduzz是一种基于LLM的自动库模糊测试技术，通过理解库的合理使用方式并提取API组合约束，优化计算资源利用，显著提高了覆盖率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有库模糊测试技术生成的驱动程序不合理，浪费计算资源且效果不佳，需要一种更智能的方法。

Method: 利用LLM理解库的合理使用方式，提取API组合约束，并通过双调度框架优化驱动程序的生成和执行。

Result: 在33个真实库中测试，Scheduzz显著减少计算开销，覆盖率和效率优于现有技术，并发现33个未知漏洞。

Conclusion: Scheduzz通过智能调度和LLM辅助，显著提升了库模糊测试的效果和效率。

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: YATE是一种通过静态分析和重新提示修复语言模型生成的错误测试的技术，显著提高了测试覆盖率和突变杀死率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的测试中许多错误测试被丢弃，修复这些测试可以提升测试价值和生成更多测试。

Method: 结合基于规则的静态分析和重新提示修复错误测试。

Result: YATE在6个开源项目中平均覆盖32.06%更多代码，杀死21.77%更多突变，优于其他LLM方法。

Conclusion: YATE是一种高效且成本可控的测试修复方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

*Jesse Maarleveld,Jiapan Guo,Daniel Feitosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了文件定位问题，提出了一种适用于所有类型问题的数据管道，并评估了传统信息检索方法的性能，发现基于特定启发式的方法在通用问题上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是开发一种适用于所有类型问题的文件定位方法，而不仅限于特定类型（如缺陷）。

Method: 提出了一种数据管道，用于创建问题文件定位数据集，并评估了传统信息检索方法的性能，同时通过统计分析研究了已知偏差的影响。

Result: 结果显示，基于特定启发式的方法在通用问题上表现不佳，不同问题类型之间存在显著性能差异，且标识符对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发通用模型的重要性，并建议方法应适应项目特定特征。

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了SystemC VP的功能，为复杂系统的软件开发和测试提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动代码审查主观性强且耗时，而现有的大语言模型缺乏逻辑推理能力，无法完全理解和评估代码。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合符号推理技术和LLMs，并在CodexGlue数据集上测试了多种模型（如CodeT5、CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了自动化代码审查的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理与LLMs的混合方法是自动化代码审查的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG在闭源代码库中的表现，弥补开源与闭源代码库之间的分布差异研究空白。

Method: 在微信工业级代码库上测试26个开源LLM，比较标识符RAG和相似性RAG，并评估不同检索技术（词法和语义）。

Result: 相似性RAG表现更优，BM25和GTE-Qwen检索技术效果突出，词法和语义检索结合效果最佳。

Conclusion: RAG在闭源代码库中有效，结合多种检索技术可进一步提升性能，开发者调查验证了其实际实用性。

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

TL;DR: VulPathFinder是一个基于图神经网络（GNN）的漏洞路径发现框架，用于解释开源软件中漏洞的根源，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SliceLocator）依赖基于规则的漏洞路径识别，泛化能力有限，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 提出VulPathFinder框架，利用GNN模型检测潜在漏洞终点（PSPs），并通过程序切片和路径排名确定最可能的漏洞路径。

Result: 在SARD数据集的缓冲区溢出漏洞评估中，VulPathFinder优于SliceLocator和GNNExplainer。

Conclusion: VulPathFinder通过GNN提升了漏洞路径发现的准确性和解释能力，为漏洞根源分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in open-source software is a critical task
that is highly regarded in the related research communities. Several approaches
have been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and
identifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to
work in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating
vulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of
the vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by
identifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that
limits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an
explainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's
methodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting
sink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN
captures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points
(PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After
detecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable
paths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based
detector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root
cause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer
overflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the
corresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder
outperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN
explainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.

TL;DR: TimelyHLS是一个结合LLM和RAG的框架，用于自动生成和优化FPGA的HLS代码，显著减少手动调整需求，提升性能和资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA的高层次合成（HLS）在实现时序收敛和设计优化时面临挑战，缺乏对平台特定pragma的自动化支持。

Method: TimelyHLS利用LLM和RAG，基于FPGA特定的知识库生成并迭代优化HLS代码，结合商业工具链验证功能正确性。

Result: 实验显示，TimelyHLS减少70%手动调整，实现高达4倍的延迟加速和50%以上的面积节省。

Conclusion: TimelyHLS证明了LLM驱动的架构感知合成在自动化FPGA设计中的有效性。

Abstract: Achieving timing closure and design-specific optimizations in FPGA-targeted
High-Level Synthesis (HLS) remains a significant challenge due to the complex
interaction between architectural constraints, resource utilization, and the
absence of automated support for platform-specific pragmas. In this work, we
propose TimelyHLS, a novel framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically generate and
iteratively refine HLS code optimized for FPGA-specific timing and performance
requirements. TimelyHLS is driven by a structured architectural knowledge base
containing FPGA-specific features, synthesis directives, and pragma templates.
Given a kernel, TimelyHLS generates HLS code annotated with both
timing-critical and design-specific pragmas. The synthesized RTL is then
evaluated using commercial toolchains, and simulation correctness is verified
against reference outputs via custom testbenches. TimelyHLS iteratively
incorporates synthesis logs and performance reports into the LLM engine for
refinement in the presence of functional discrepancies. Experimental results
across 10 FPGA architectures and diverse benchmarks show that TimelyHLS reduces
the need for manual tuning by up to 70%, while achieving up to 4x latency
speedup (e.g., 3.85x for Matrix Multiplication, 3.7x for Bitonic Sort) and over
50% area savings in certain cases (e.g., 57% FF reduction in Viterbi).
TimelyHLS consistently achieves timing closure and functional correctness
across platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-driven,
architecture-aware synthesis in automating FPGA design.

experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while

TL;DR: 论文揭示了深度生成网络（GNets）通过级联隐藏网络（HNet）嵌入水印的漏洞，提出两种攻击方法成功移除水印并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是发现并验证GNets和HNet封装在黑箱（ONet）中的水印系统存在漏洞，即使攻击者系统知识有限，仍能通过逆向工程泄露未标记图像。

Method: 提出两种攻击方法：1）通过精心设计的输入图像逆向HNet的逆模型；2）利用等效加性特性逆向HNet的前向代理模型。

Result: 两种方法均实现100%水印移除成功率，图像质量最高PSNR达34.69 dB，远超现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了盒免费模型水印的严重漏洞，亟需开发更鲁棒的防御策略。

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep generative networks (GNets) can be
protected using a cascaded hiding network (HNet) which embeds watermarks (or
marks) into GNet outputs, known as box-free watermarking. Although both GNet
and HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet),
with only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end
users and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability
in such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still
be reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the
generated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the
system. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet
under the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the
query process with specially curated input images. While effective, this method
yields unsatisfactory image quality. To improve this, we subsequently propose
an alternative method leveraging the equivalent additive property of box-free
model watermarking and reverse-engineering a forward surrogate model of HNet,
with better image quality preservation. Extensive experimental results on image
processing and image generation tasks demonstrate that both attacks achieve
impressive watermark removal success rates (100%) while also maintaining
excellent image quality (reaching the highest PSNR of 34.69 dB), substantially
outperforming existing attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust
defensive strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerability in box-free model
watermarking.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非侵入式的水印服务（NWaaS）方法ShadowMark，用于保护深度神经网络（DNN）模型的知识产权，无需修改模型参数或结构，解决了现有方法的侵入性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN水印方法因修改模型参数或结构而具有侵入性，可能导致模型行为变化和额外调优成本，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出NWaaS范式，通过ShadowMark实现，利用黑盒API建立非侵入式侧信道，结合密钥编码器和水印解码器提取水印。

Result: 实验表明，ShadowMark在多种DNN架构中实现绝对保真度，且对攻击具有鲁棒性，消除了保真度与鲁棒性的权衡。

Conclusion: ShadowMark为非侵入式DNN水印提供了实用解决方案，适用于多种模型类型，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了视觉输入作为攻击面的潜力，导致LVLMs对RCAs的防御不足。

Method: 提出Vision Guided Optimization和Multi-Objective Parallel Losses，生成对抗性扰动以触发无限制输出。

Result: RECALLED显著增加了服务响应延迟（26↑）和GPU利用率（20%↑）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs的安全漏洞，为未来防御RCAs提供了框架。

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python开发依赖第三方包，但依赖链中的漏洞可能传播，影响下游软件。PyPI缺乏对漏洞依赖的全面分析。

Method: 分析了378,573个PyPI包的依赖结构，识别直接或间接依赖已知漏洞版本的包。

Result: 发现4,655个包直接依赖漏洞版本，141,044个包允许漏洞版本范围。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Python软件供应链的安全问题，旨在提高安全意识。

Abstract: Python software development heavily relies on third-party packages. Direct
and transitive dependencies create a labyrinth of software supply chains. While
it is convenient to reuse code, vulnerabilities within these dependency chains
can propagate through dependencies, potentially affecting down-stream packages
and applications. PyPI, the official Python package repository, hosts many
packages and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of vulnerable
dependencies. This paper introduces PyPitfall, a quantitative analysis of
vulnerable dependencies across the PyPI ecosystem. We analyzed the dependency
structures of 378,573 PyPI packages and identified 4,655 packages that
explicitly require at least one known-vulnerable version and 141,044 packages
that permit vulnerable versions within specified ranges. By characterizing the
ecosystem-wide dependency landscape and the security impact of transitive
dependencies, we aim to raise awareness of Python software supply chain
security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI辅助密码分析和量子计算技术的发展，传统ChaCha密码的安全性面临挑战，需要进一步强化其安全性。

Method: 改进版QRE-ChaCha通过将初始常数与量子随机数异或，并在奇数轮中定期注入量子随机数到状态字中，增强扩散性。

Result: QRE-ChaCha表现出更强的差分攻击抵抗力，生成的密钥流具有统计随机性，并通过了NIST和GM/T 0005-2021的随机性测试。

Conclusion: QRE-ChaCha在保持高效性的同时显著提升了安全性，适用于密码学应用。

Abstract: Due to the merits of high efficiency and strong security against timing and
side-channel attacks, ChaCha has been widely applied in real-time communication
and data streaming scenarios. However, with the rapid development of
AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious
challenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen
the security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum
random numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha).
Specifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers
and periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words
during odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the
present variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates
a keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness
against both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and
performance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts.
Firstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and
attack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search
method based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject
the keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST
statistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard.
Finally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its
encryption speed on files of various sizes. According to the results, the
present ChaCha is significantly improved to resist differential attacks while
maintaining the high efficiency of the original ChaCha cipher, and its
keystream successfully passes statistical randomness tests using the NIST and
GM/T 0005-2021 standards, meeting cryptographic application requirements.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in

optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

Abstract: Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to
cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is
indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of
critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate
cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures
against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity
experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap
between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber
range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and
training using production environment. However, the design and implementation
of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect
of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of
cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges
are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of
configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address
these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is
presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based
modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which
incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a
toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional
smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily
shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The
application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale
substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been
open-sourced.

### [31] [LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302)
*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出LoRA-Leak框架，评估LoRA微调语言模型的数据隐私风险，发现预训练模型加剧了成员推理攻击（MIA）的威胁，并探索了防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为LoRA微调数据不易受MIA攻击，但忽略了预训练模型可能带来的信息泄露风险。

Method: 引入LoRA-Leak框架，整合15种MIA方法（包括5种改进方法），评估LoRA微调模型的隐私风险。

Result: 实验表明LoRA微调模型仍易受MIA攻击（如AUC达0.775），并发现仅dropout和排除特定层能有效防御。

Conclusion: 预训练模型加剧了LoRA微调模型的MIA风险，需关注数据隐私保护。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

and k-anonymity were investigated and applied to datasets containing personal
and sensitive data. The analysis revealed significant variations in the
effectiveness of each method, highlighting the need to balance privacy and data
utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着技术普及和硬件能力提升，数字证据在调查中增多，但处理大量数据耗时且繁琐，需要降低误报率。

Method: Scout结合文本和多模态大型语言模型，从磁盘映像、网络数据包等中识别相关证据。

Result: Scout能有效识别潜在证据文件，为调查者节省时间。

Conclusion: Scout通过自动化初步证据处理，显著提升数字取证效率。

Abstract: Recent technological advancements and the prevalence of technology in day to
day activities have caused a major increase in the likelihood of the
involvement of digital evidence in more and more legal investigations.
Consumer-grade hardware is growing more powerful, with expanding memory and
storage sizes and enhanced processor capabilities. Forensics investigators
often have to sift through gigabytes of data during an ongoing investigation
making the process tedious. Memory forensics, disk analysis all are well
supported by state of the art tools that significantly lower the effort
required to be put in by a forensic investigator by providing string searches,
analyzing images file etc. During the course of the investigation a lot of
false positives are identified that need to be lowered. This work presents
Scout, a digital forensics framework that performs preliminary evidence
processing and prioritizing using large language models. Scout deploys
foundational language models to identify relevant artifacts from a large number
of potential evidence files (disk images, captured network packets, memory
dumps etc.) which would have taken longer to get identified. Scout employs text
based large language models can easily process files with textual information.
For the forensic analysis of multimedia files like audio, image, video, office
documents etc. multimodal models are employed by Scout. Scout was able to
identify and realize the evidence file that were of potential interest for the
investigator.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展和普及，微调对齐模型成为适应实际应用的关键步骤，但其安全性问题日益突出。研究发现，即使使用看似无害的下游数据集微调，LLMs的安全性也可能被破坏。

Method: 提出LARF方法，通过识别LLM中的安全敏感层，并利用其表征检测微调数据中具有安全降级特征的样本。

Result: 实验证明LARF能有效识别具有安全降级特征的良性数据，移除这些数据后可缓解微调导致的安全对齐退化。

Conclusion: LARF为微调LLMs时的安全性问题提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning
aligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world
applications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important
than ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even
when fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of
aligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious
instructions. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain
samples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the
surface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs
during fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a
\textbf{L}ayer-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{F}iltering
method. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and
leverages their representations to detect which data samples in the
post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features. Experimental results
demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with
safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment
degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 符号回归（SR）用于揭示复杂物理系统中可解释的数学关系，结合知识表示框架（ASP）提升模型可靠性和物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解流动物理与准确预测同样重要，SR无需先验模型假设，适合揭示流动特性。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值模拟数据中推导符号方程，并结合ASP框架确保物理合理性。

Result: SR生成的方程准确近似了抛物线速度分布和压力降，与文献解析解一致。

Conclusion: SR简化复杂流动行为为可解释方程，结合ASP提升数据驱动模型的可靠性和领域一致性。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

Motivation: 现有系统在自动化洞察生成中忽视了结构化推理过程，而真实数据分析需要一致的认知工作流。

Method: 提出I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务模拟分析推理的认知步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I-STRADA在规划连贯性和洞察对齐方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析智能体设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Motivation: 定性时间线规划的计划存在性问题已知为PSPACE完全，但非确定性自动机无法直接用于合成策略，需进行昂贵的确定性转换。

Method: 通过将计划存在性问题映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，并识别适合该确定性片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Result: 找到了一种可直接合成策略的确定性片段，并确定了适合该片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 该研究为定性时间线规划提供了一种更高效的策略合成方法，避免了非确定性自动机的确定性转换开销。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正的创造力，提出‘创意潜力隐藏在失败中’的理念。

Method: 采用五阶段生成管道（E.A.R.T.H.），结合结构化提示、语义评分和人类反馈，使用多种模型（如LLaMA-2-7B-Chat、SBERT等）和复合奖励函数。

Result: 创造力评分提升70.4%，精炼后的口号更短、更新颖，跨模态测试显示强对齐，人类评价中60%输出得分≥4.0。

Conclusion: 错误驱动和反馈驱动的生成方法可增强AI创造力，为自演化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可扩展路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

Result: 在43个任务和6个环境中，MAGPO表现优于现有CTDE方法，甚至媲美完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论支持和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for

Conclusion: 该框架降低了专家干预需求，为临床AI提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Result: 该方法能够更准确、高效地从急诊记录中识别疫苗安全问题，减少假阳性。

Conclusion: NLP与主动学习的结合为疫苗安全监测提供了快速、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine

### [45] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，而在均匀设置下低于求和和最大聚合GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索均值聚合GNNs的表达能力及其与其他聚合函数的比较，以理解其在图数据建模中的潜力与局限。

Method: 通过理论分析比较均值聚合GNNs在非均匀和均匀设置下的表达能力，并与模态逻辑和MSO（Monadic Second-Order Logic）进行关联。

Result: 非均匀设置下，均值GNNs与比率模态逻辑等价；均匀设置下，其表达能力低于求和和最大聚合GNNs。

Conclusion: 均值聚合GNNs的表达能力受设置和假设条件影响，灵活性较高但均匀设置下较弱。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [46] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知归因框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）的认知分解为知识检索和推理调整两个阶段，通过不同认知模式分析其贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分LLMs中的知识和推理能力对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要，受双系统认知理论启发，研究如何量化两者的贡献。

Method: 通过快速思维和慢速思维两种认知模式提示LLMs生成答案，分析不同模式下的表现以量化知识和推理的贡献。

Result: 研究发现推理调整具有领域特异性，参数扩展显著提升知识和推理能力，且知识主要分布在网络低层，推理则在高层。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅从解耦角度理解LLMs，还为现有研究（如扩展定律、分层知识编辑和小模型推理限制）提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [47] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种不遵循模型最小化原则的析取语义，证明其中三种方法（Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛）实际上一致，并构成了一种共同方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨析取在Answer Set Programming中的非最小化语义，比较不同方法的异同。

Method: 比较四种析取语义：Justified Models、Strongly Supported Models、Forks和DI语义，分析其定义和关系。

Result: 证明Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛一致，且强于Strongly Supported Models。

Conclusion: 共同语义提供了稳定模型的超集，且比Strongly Supported Models更强。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个定性风险评估的概念框架，结合定义平衡和可废止推理，以应对欧盟AI法案下的法律合规性和基本权利保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI部署场景中的法律合规性和基本权利保护问题，特别是在欧盟AI法案的背景下。

Method: 采用定义平衡（比例分析）和可废止推理，分析AI部署场景及其对基本权利的多层次影响。

Result: 提供了一个逻辑化的AI风险分析哲学基础，支持对高风险AI和通用AI系统的评估。

Conclusion: 未来工作将开发正式模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决评估学生物理考试答案正确性的挑战性问题。

Method: 结合计算机代数系统、SMT求解器和项重写系统，利用大型语言模型处理学生答案，并通过自动推理技术评估正确性。

Result: 在2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克竞赛的1500多份真实学生答案上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，但开发项重写系统并确保其终止性和合流性具有挑战性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs基准多关注事实准确性或逐步逻辑，而金融领域需要创造性思维和不确定性下的决策能力。

Method: ConDiFi通过宏观金融提示和多跳对抗性MCQs评估发散和收敛思维。

Result: GPT-4o在新颖性和可操作性上表现不佳，DeepSeek-R1和Cohere Command R+表现突出。

Conclusion: ConDiFi为评估LLMs在金融领域的安全和战略部署提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和RL算法中验证了IB正则化的有效性，性能一致提升。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，且轻量级IB正则化方法易于实现，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化呼叫中心路由以减少客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Method: 比较基于模型（VI）和无模型（PPO）方法，使用MDP框架和SBR模型。

Result: PPO在1000次测试中表现最佳，但训练时间较长。

Conclusion: PPO是优化呼叫中心路由的有效方法，尽管训练时间较长。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的CPU方法在处理包含数百或数千个有效案例的表格约束时效率不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 实验验证表明，GPU加速的CT算法在大量实例中表现优异。

Conclusion: GPU加速的CT算法为处理大规模表格约束问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Conclusion: 强调了训练数据在概念探测中的重要性，并提供了相关数据集标签。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有对齐方法（如RLHF）仅学习人类偏好的局限性，开发具有内在安全推理和自我反思能力的AI。

Method: 采用SafeLadder框架，结合大规模、渐进式、安全导向的强化学习后训练，并辅以多原则验证器。

Conclusion: SafeWork-R1及其衍生模型证明安全与能力可协同进化，验证了框架的通用性和可靠性。

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.
