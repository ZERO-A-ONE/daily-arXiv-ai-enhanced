Despite this transformation, the field\nlacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions\ninterconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey\npresents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,\nbridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We\nanalyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy\nspanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,\nfine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code\ngeneration, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the\nfield has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems\nincorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory\nmechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that\nillustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final\ndeliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying\ncomplexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys\nthat focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting\n50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling\nresearchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future\ndirections, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code\ngeneration systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based\nmethods.

Many mainstream\nlibraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD\nintrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software\necosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV)\nextension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics\nis a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture\ntranslation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and\nerror-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for\nmanual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete\nrule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from\ninadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a\nLLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to\ntranslate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further\noptimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived\nfrom liveness analysis.

A second contribution is a\npersistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence\nis updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition\nplanning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project\nsubset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM\nanalyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest\nprecision trade-off.

We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly\nseparates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an\ninternal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in\na directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and\ncontradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that\nmixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,\nstable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:\nhigh-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference\nis safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that\nseeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and\napplies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to\nbuild a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that\nlocally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving\ncontractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized\nreconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the\nentire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with\nplanted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.\nThe result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that\nactivates classical logic precisely where structure supports it."}

As a principled algorithm, PALU\nformulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing\nresponse length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies\nLagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.\nAs a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through\nthree approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)\ntruncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing\ngradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces\noutput length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to\nDeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a\nrange of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across\nboth domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching\nthe algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach."}

This paper proposes a\nnovel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient\nZero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key\ncontributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of\nstrong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove\nthat their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., \"age is over 18\")\nwithout revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,\nprivacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic\naccumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in\nlarge-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery\nscheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a\nprototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively\nanalyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,\nverification overhead, and on-chain costs.

However, existing\napproaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel\nmeasurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of\nreciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise,\nasynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections --\nall of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the\nquantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors,\nfurther limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for\nsecret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust\nand reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover\nhidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models\nfor efficient key agreement.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nformalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible\nthreat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and\ncapabilities.

In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the\nperformance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the\nleast degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and\nChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER\noutperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while\nachieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%.

This\ncognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and\nshort-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment\n(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a\nstructured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we\nintroduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000\npreference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a\nmulti-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning\nchains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to\ninstill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process\nReward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized\nreasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's\nalignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this\nrationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides\npolicy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online\nreinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural\nlanguage feedback.

This separation ensures\nquality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once\nand reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also\nprovides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon\nreasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for\nreliable agent-driven automation.

Existing evaluations\ntypically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of\nwhether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect\ntransformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and\nerode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this\ngap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript\nobfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to\ngenerate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language\nconstructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable\nprograms and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides\nLLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic\nextraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more\nfocused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain\nknowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown\ncorrectness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose\nstate-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,\nFuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary\nfocus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components\nexcept our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR\nresult suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations.

It does so by adding external data into the\nLLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that\ninserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,\nredirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'\nsafety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift\nretrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target\nperturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets\nintroduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL\ninjection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety\nalignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a\nnew class of attacks on LLMs."}

Watermarking has emerged as a promising\nsolution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on\nhand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or\ntask-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across\nlanguages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking\nframework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its\nsemantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)\nSemantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving\ntransformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison\nExtraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the\noriginal and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization\nability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training\npipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and\nattack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability."}

In\nthis study, we investigate how developers engage with Amazon's CodeWhisperer,\nan LLM-based code-generation tool. We conducted two user studies with two\ngroups of 10 participants each, interacting with CodeWhisperer - the first to\nunderstand which interactions were critical to capture and the second to\ncollect low-level interaction data using a custom telemetry plugin. Our\nmixed-methods analysis identified four behavioral patterns: 1) incremental code\nrefinement, 2) explicit instruction using natural language comments, 3)\nbaseline structuring with model suggestions, and 4) integrative use with\nexternal sources. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these patterns ."}

We present\n\\textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed\nto capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code\n(VS Code) editor. \\textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such\nas insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts,\nenabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user\nworkflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API,\nand a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of\ndeployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \\textit{CodeWatcher}\nenables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich\nbehavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development.\nThis infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI,\ndeveloper productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs.

Existing\nbenchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately\nassess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce\nPACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles\nof realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber\ndefenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,\nblended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these\ncomplex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human\npenetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and\nexploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that\ncurrent models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass\ndefenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a\ngeneralized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust\nbenchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models."}
