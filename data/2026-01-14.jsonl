While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, they often hallucinate non-existent UI elements. We present the Autonomous QA Agent, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that grounds Selenium script generation in project-specific documentation and HTML structure. By ingesting diverse formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML) into a vector database, our system retrieves relevant context before generation. Evaluation on 20 e-commerce test scenarios shows our RAG approach achieves 100% (20/20) syntax validity and 90% (18/20, 95% CI: [85%, 95%], p < 0.001) execution success, compared to 30% for standard LLM generation. While our evaluation is limited to a single domain, our method significantly reduces hallucinations by grounding generation in actual DOM structure, demonstrating RAG's potential for automated UI testing."}

LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible plans or silent contract violations, amplified by BOM coupling. We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation. A self-contained synthetic micro-benchmark (500 instances; T=5) computed by exact enumeration under an execution model with MOQ uplift and emergency purchases shows heavy-tailed regret and nontrivial MOQ-violation incidence for extraction-only planning, motivating verification as a first-class component of contract-grounded planning systems."}

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment. This transformation bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation."}

RiskBridge employs a probabilistic Zero-Day Exposure Simulation (ZDES) model to forecast near-term exploit likelihood, a Policy-as-Code Engine to translate regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST SP 800-53) into automated SLA logic, and an ROI-driven Optimizer to maximize cumulative risk reduction per remediation effort. Experimental evaluations using live CVE datasets demonstrate an 88% reduction in residual risk, an 18-day improvement in SLA compliance, and a 35% increase in remediation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art commercial baselines. These findings validate RiskBridge as a practical and auditable decision-intelligence system that unifies probabilistic modeling, compliance reasoning, and optimization analytics.

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence. If we fear the creature, it is because we recognize in it the apple that we ourselves have poisoned."}

However, little is known about how SATD manifests and evolves in contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, whose architectures, workflows, and dependencies differ fundamentally from both traditional and pre-LLM ML software. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt.

In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications."}

Automatic question generation has become an effective strategy for personalized and adaptive learning. However, its effectiveness is hindered by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), which may generate factually incorrect, ambiguous, or pedagogically inconsistent questions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines causal-graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a multi-agent LLM architecture. This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints. A dual validation mechanism-at both the conceptual and output stages-greatly reduces hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 70% improvement in quality compared to reference methods and yielded highly favorable outcomes in subjective evaluations."}

Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively."}

These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.\n  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.\n  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.\n  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.\n  \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems"}

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization.

These agents differ fundamentally from traditional software: their behavior is not fixed at deployment but continuously shaped by experience, feedback, and context. Applying operational principles inherited from DevOps or MLOps, built for deterministic software and traditional ML systems, assumes that system behavior can be managed through versioning, monitoring, and rollback. This assumption breaks down for Agentic AI systems whose learning trajectories diverge over time. This introduces non-determinism making system reliability a challenge at runtime. We argue that architecting such systems requires a shift from managing control loops to enabling dynamic co-evolution among agents, infrastructure, and human oversight. To guide this shift, we introduce CHANGE, a conceptual framework comprising six capabilities for operationalizing Agentic AI systems: Contextualize, Harmonize, Anticipate, Negotiate, Generate, and Evolve.

Ismail and Anthony Kuang", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often encode cognitive behaviors unpredictably across prompts, layers, and contexts, making them difficult to diagnose and control. We present CBMAS, a diagnostic framework for continuous activation steering, which extends cognitive bias analysis from discrete before/after interventions to interpretable trajectories. By combining steering vector construction with dense α-sweeps, logit lens-based bias curves, and layer-site sensitivity analysis, our approach can reveal tipping points where small intervention strengths flip model behavior and show how steering effects evolve across layer depth. We argue that these continuous diagnostics offer a bridge between high-level behavioral evaluation and low-level representational dynamics, contributing to the cognitive interpretability of LLMs. Lastly, we provide a CLI and datasets for various cognitive behaviors at the project repository, https://github.com/shimamooo/CBMAS."}

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation."}

However, inaccurate captions may mislead users and expose developers to regulatory fines. Existing approaches to generating privacy notices or just privacy captions include using questionnaires, templates, static analysis, or machine learning. However, these approaches either rely heavily on developers' inputs and thus strain their efforts, use limited source code context, leading to the incomplete capture of app privacy behaviors, or depend on potentially inaccurate privacy policies as a source for creating notices. In this work, we address these limitations by developing Privacy Caption Generator (PCapGen), an approach that - i) automatically identifies and extracts large and precise source code context that implements privacy behaviors in an app, ii) uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to describe coarse- and fine-grained privacy behaviors, and iii) generates accurate, concise, and complete privacy captions to describe the privacy behaviors of the app. Our evaluation shows PCapGen generates concise, complete, and accurate privacy captions as compared to the baseline approach. Furthermore, privacy experts choose PCapGen captions at least 71\\% of the time, whereas LLMs-as-judge prefer PCapGen captions at least 76\\% of the time, indicating strong performance of our approach."}

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response."}

For rigorous evaluation, the authors introduce FixtureEval, a dedicated benchmark comprising 600 curated functions across two Programming Languages (PLs), i.e., Python and Java, with explicit fixture dependency labels, enabling both the corresponding classification and generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that Fixturize is highly effective, achieving 88.38%-97.00% accuracy across benchmarks in identifying the dependence of test fixtures and significantly enhancing the Suite Pass rate (SuitePS) by 18.03%-42.86% on average across both PLs with the auto-generated fixtures.

We argue that large language models (LLMs) have democratized web scraping, enabling low-skill users to execute sophisticated operations through simple natural language prompts. While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites. In light of these findings, we provide simple procedures for novices to use these workflows and gauge what adversaries could achieve using these."}

ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,ε,λ)$, \\textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift). We evaluate two models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) and two agent architectures (ReAct, Reflexion) across four domains (scheduling, travel, customer support, e-commerce) over 1,280 episodes. Perturbations alone reduce success from 96.9% at $ε=0$ to 88.1% at $ε=0.2$. Rate limiting is the most damaging fault in ablations.

The study employed a structured questionnaire administered to professionals from Science and Technology Institutions (STIs) located in Manaus, Brazil, aiming to capture reported practices, perceptions of quality, and recurrent challenges. Quantitative data were complemented by qualitative responses to support contextual interpretation. The results indicate that although practices such as automated testing, code review, and continuous integration are widely acknowledged, their reported application is often inconsistent across iterations.

Existing length extrapolation methods often suffer from performance degradation or computational inefficiencies. We thereby use a unified framework that reinterprets positional encoding methods as a decomposition of the attention score into a multiplicative transformation and an additive bias. This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions for infinite-context extrapolation, ensuring that the softmax normalization remains well-defined over unbounded sequences while preserving long-distance correlations, entropy boundedness and gradient positional sensitivity.

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data. It shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of using comparative judgment test data for model evaluations."}

Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience."}

Recently, we have witnessed a paradigm shift that takes these techniques off the shelf and studies how to use them together to achieve the best results. One notable work is DP-FETA, which proposes using `central images' for `warming up' the DP training and then using traditional DP-SGD.\n  Inspired by DP-FETA, we are curious whether there are other such tools we can use together with DP-SGD. We first observe that using `central images' mainly works for datasets where there are many samples that look similar. To handle scenarios where images could vary significantly, we propose FETA-Pro, which introduces frequency features as `training shortcuts.' The complexity of frequency features lies between that of spatial features (captured by `central images') and full images, allowing for a finer-grained curriculum for DP training. To incorporate these two types of shortcuts together, one challenge is to handle the training discrepancy between spatial and frequency features. To address it, we leverage the pipeline generation property of generative models (instead of having one model trained with multiple features/objectives, we can have multiple models working on different features, then feed the generated results from one model into another) and use a more flexible design. Specifically, FETA-Pro introduces an auxiliary generator to produce images aligned with noisy frequency features. Then, another model is trained with these images, together with spatial features and DP-SGD. Evaluated across five sensitive image datasets, FETA-Pro shows an average of 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than the best-performing baseline, under a privacy budget $ε= 1$."}

We therefore introduce PenForge, a framework that dynamically constructs expert agents during testing rather than relying on those prepared beforehand. By integrating automated reconnaissance of potential attack surfaces with agents instantiated on the fly for context-aware exploitation, PenForge achieves a 30.0% exploit success rate (12/40) on CVE-Bench in the particularly challenging zero-day setting, which is a 3 times improvement over the state-of-the-art.

We prove that a strict noise reduction by our approach always exists compared to $1$-Wasserstein mechanism for all privacy budgets $ε$ and prior beliefs, and the noise reduction (also represents improvement on data utility) gains increase significantly for low privacy budget situations--which are commonly seen in real-world deployments. We also analyze the variation and optimality of the noise reduction with different prior distributions. Moreover, all the properties of the noise reduction still exist in the worst-case $1$-Wasserstein mechanism we introduced, when the additive noise is largest.

This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times."}

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%."}

Today, securing these languages still demands substantial human effort to craft and enforce rules, imposing heavy burdens on typical administrators and creating critical production risks (e.g., misoperations that shut down servers).Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, vulnerability detection, and automated repair for languages like Python and JavaScript. However, their ability to assist with generating secure scripting-language code remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present SecGenEval-PS, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on secure scripting generation, security analysis, and automated repair. Our results show that both proprietary and open-source models fall short in these areas. For instance, over 60% of PowerShell scripts produced by GPT-4o and o3-mini are insecure without structured guidance.To bridge this gap, we propose PSSec, a framework that combines data synthesis with fine-tuning to enhance model security capabilities. We develop a self-debugging agent that integrates static analyzers with the reasoning abilities of advanced LLMs to synthesize large-scale structured triplets of insecure scripts, violation analyses, and corresponding repairs. We then fine-tune lightweight LLMs (as small as 1.7B parameters) using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), enabling security-aware reasoning and the generation of secure PowerShell code.Across multiple LLM families, including GPT and Qwen, \\textit{PSSec}-trained models match or surpass general-purpose large models on PowerShell security tasks while reducing inference cost by more than an order of magnitude."}

Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools. Comprehensive experiments conducted with this system demonstrate that NL2Dashboard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, achieving superior visual quality, significantly higher token efficiency, and precise controllability in both generation and modification tasks."}

Yet, their adoption within agile environments remains underexplored. Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners adopt GenAI tools in real-world organizational contexts, focusing on regulatory conditions, use cases, benefits, and barriers. Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints. This leads to systematic gaps between policy and practice. Conclusion: GenAI offers significant potential to augment agile roles but requires alignment across TOE dimensions, including clear policies, data protection measures, and user training to ensure responsible and effective integration."}

Both lack the generality needed to handle heterogeneous VRC deployments.\n  We present ViPer, a unified attack framework that integrates structured multi-object visual perception with adaptive LLM-based reasoning. ViPer parses visual layouts, grounds attributes to question semantics, and infers target coordinates within a modular pipeline. Evaluated on six major VRC providers (VTT, Geetest, NetEase, Dingxiang, Shumei, Xiaodun), ViPer achieves up to 93.2% success, approaching human-level performance across multiple benchmarks. Compared to prior solvers, GraphNet (83.2%), Oedipus (65.8%), and the Holistic approach (89.5%), ViPer consistently outperforms all baselines. The framework further maintains robustness across alternative LLM backbones (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi), sustaining accuracy above 90%.\n  To anticipate defense, we further introduce Template-Space Randomization (TSR), a lightweight strategy that perturbs linguistic templates without altering task semantics.

To address these issues, we propose SecureDyn-FL, a comprehensive and robust privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework tailored for intrusion detection in IoT networks. SecureDyn-FL is designed to simultaneously address multiple security dimensions in FL-based IDS: (1) poisoning detection through dynamic temporal gradient auditing, (2) privacy protection against inference and eavesdropping attacks through secure aggregation, and (3) adaptation to heterogeneous non-IID data via personalized learning. The framework introduces three core contributions: (i) a dynamic temporal gradient auditing mechanism that leverages Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) to detect stealthy and adaptive poisoning attacks, (ii) an optimized privacy-preserving aggregation scheme based on transformed additive ElGamal encryption with adaptive pruning and quantization for secure and efficient communication, and (iii) a dual-objective personalized learning strategy that improves model adaptation under non-IID data using logit-adjusted loss. Extensive experiments on the N-BaIoT dataset under both IID and non-IID settings, including scenarios with up to 50% adversarial clients, demonstrate that SecureDyn-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based IDS defenses."}

At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM. The resulting model produces consistent, identifiable persona-aligned behaviors for specified Big Five configurations and matches or exceeds several larger untuned LLMs and other untuned baselines on our metrics: persona consistency, contextual appropriateness, style matching, trait identifiability, and long-horizon stability.

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) can be a promising solution to address these challenges by embedding decisions directly within system models, which can reduce the capture workload while maintaining explicit links to requirements, behaviors, and architectural elements. This article discusses a lightweight framework for integrating decision capture into MBSE workflows by representing decision alternatives as system model slices.

This research investigates the effectiveness of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as a sustainable cybersecurity solution tailored to SMBs. While ZTA adoption has been examined broadly, the specific financial, organizational, and capability constraints of SMBs remain underexplored. This study develops an integrated predictive model to assess both the feasibility and risk-mitigation potential of ZTA implementation. The model consists of two sub-models. The first sub-model evaluates the probability of successful ZTA adoption considering implied barriers, and the second tests the effectiveness of ZTA in responding to prevalent cyberattacks.

To address this, we propose Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE), a geometric framework operating on a counter-intuitive \"Student Guides Teacher\" paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a weak auxiliary agent not for imitation, but as an orthogonal probe. By explicitly navigating the Teacher's Null Space, SOE serves as a geometric bridge, effectively ejecting the model from local optima to explore diverse, high-value solution spaces. Experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that, relative to baseline methods, our approach improves average accuracy by 62.4% and increases average sampling efficiency by 113.7%, indicating a promising path toward overcoming performance plateaus in advanced reasoning tasks."}

Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation. Conclusions: FairRF is an effective approach for bias mitigation also allowing stakeholders to adapt the development of fair software systems based on their specific needs."}

Recent passkey deployments address this limitation by enabling multi-device credentials synchronized via platform-specific cloud ecosystems. However, these approaches require users and organizations to trust the corresponding cloud or phone providers with the protection and availability of their authentication material. In parallel, qualified electronic signature (QES) tokens and smart-card--based PKCS#11 modules provide high-assurance, hardware-rooted identity, yet they are not directly compatible with WebAuthn flows.\n  This paper explores architectural options for bridging these technologies by securing a virtual FIDO2 authenticator with a QES-grade PKCS#11 key and enabling encrypted cloud synchronization of FIDO2 private keys. We first present and implement a baseline architecture in which the cloud stores only ciphertext and the decryption capability remains anchored exclusively in the user's hardware token. We then propose a hardened variant that introduces an Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)-based mechanism bound to a local user-verification factor, thereby mitigating cross-protocol misuse and ensuring that synchronization keys cannot be repurposed outside the intended FIDO2 semantics; this enhanced design is analyzed but not implemented. Both architectures preserve a pure WebAuthn/FIDO2 interface to relying parties while offering different trust and deployment trade-offs. We provide the system model, threat analysis, implementation of the baseline architecture, and experimental evaluation, followed by a discussion of the hardened variant's security implications for high-assurance authentication deployments."}

In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions. Using constrained optimisation and Markov decision processes, we show how improved estimation affects optimal allocation under scarcity. A synthetic triage simulation demonstrates that allocation-aware policies substantially outperform risk-threshold approaches in realised utility, even with identical predictive accuracy.

Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers.

A Factorial Analysis Methodology for Diagnosing the Trade-off between Preference Alignment and Real-World Validity", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \\times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness. These findings offer a novel, reproducible factorial evaluation methodology that provides finer-grained diagnostics for post-training processes like RLHF, enabling better trade-offs in the product iteration of LLMs by offering a more nuanced understanding of preference alignment risks and the impact of manipulative prompts."}

We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DDCOP) that models integrated scheduling and execution. DCOSP has a novel optimality condition for which we construct an omniscient offline algorithm for its computation. We also present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search algorithm (D-NSS), an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP algorithm that repairs and solves sub-problems when problem dynamics occur. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume. As part of the NASA FAME mission, DCOSP and D-NSS will be the foundation of the largest in-space demonstration of distributed multi-agent AI to date."}

As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs."}

Does an LLM answer a certain way because the evidence is factually strong, because of a prior belief, or merely because it is repeated frequently? To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design."}

Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively."}

Existing watermarking methods (1) remain vulnerable to real-world adversarial threats, often forced to trade off between defenses against spoofing and removal attacks; and (2) cannot support semantic-level tamper localization. We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization. Unlike existing inherent watermark methods that only embed watermarks at noise initialization of diffusion models, we design a novel key-conditioned deflection mechanism that subtly steers the denoising trajectory according to the user key. Such trajectory-level coupling further strengthens the semantic entanglement of identity and content, thereby further enhancing robustness against real-world threats. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical analysis proving that only the valid key can pass verification. Experiments across 12 attack methods show that PAI achieves 98.43\\% verification accuracy, improving over SOTA methods by 37.25\\% on average, and retains strong tampering localization performance even against advanced AIGC edits.

However, inaccurate captions may mislead users and expose developers to regulatory fines. Existing approaches to generating privacy notices or just privacy captions include using questionnaires, templates, static analysis, or machine learning. However, these approaches either rely heavily on developers' inputs and thus strain their efforts, use limited source code context, leading to the incomplete capture of app privacy behaviors, or depend on potentially inaccurate privacy policies as a source for creating notices. In this work, we address these limitations by developing Privacy Caption Generator (PCapGen), an approach that - i) automatically identifies and extracts large and precise source code context that implements privacy behaviors in an app, ii) uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to describe coarse- and fine-grained privacy behaviors, and iii) generates accurate, concise, and complete privacy captions to describe the privacy behaviors of the app. Our evaluation shows PCapGen generates concise, complete, and accurate privacy captions as compared to the baseline approach. Furthermore, privacy experts choose PCapGen captions at least 71\\% of the time, whereas LLMs-as-judge prefer PCapGen captions at least 76\\% of the time, indicating strong performance of our approach."}

For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline. Our LoRA-based fine-tuning results indicate a positive correlation between model performance and the parameter scale of the base models.

We argue that large language models (LLMs) have democratized web scraping, enabling low-skill users to execute sophisticated operations through simple natural language prompts. While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites. In light of these findings, we provide simple procedures for novices to use these workflows and gauge what adversaries could achieve using these."}

Motivated by these limitations, this paper presents a near realistic synthetic APT dataset and an efficient alert correlation framework. The proposed approach introduces a machine learning based correlation module that employs K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering with a cosine similarity metric to group semantically related alerts within a temporal context. The dataset emulates multistage APT campaigns across campus and organizational network environments and captures a diverse set of fourteen distinct alert types, exceeding the coverage of commonly used synthetic APT datasets. In addition, explicit APT campaign states and alert to stage mappings are defined to enable flexible integration of new alert types and support stage aware analysis. A comprehensive statistical characterization of the dataset is provided to facilitate reproducibility and support APT stage predictions."}

Network-level analysis and long-term observation of publicly available transactions can often be used to infer user identities. To mitigate this, several blockchain applications rely on relayers, which serve as intermediary nodes between users and smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. However, dependence on a single relayer not only creates a single point of failure but also introduces exploitable vulnerabilities that weaken the system's privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a decentralized relayer architecture that enhances privacy and reliability through game-theoretic incentive design. We model the interaction among relayers as a non-cooperative game and design an incentive mechanism in which probabilistic uploading emerges as a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. Using evolutionary game analysis, we demonstrate the equilibrium's stability against perturbations and coordinated deviations. Through numerical evaluations, we analyze how equilibrium strategies and system behavior evolve with key parameters such as the number of relayers, upload costs, rewards, and penalties. In particular, we show that even with high transaction costs, the system maintains reliability with an outage probability below 0.05 . Furthermore, our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between privacy, reliability, robustness, and cost in decentralized relayer systems."}

While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one."}

We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths. Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening.

We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios."}

Conventional centralized data processing methods expose sensitive data to risk of breaches, compelling the need to use decentralized and secure data methods. This paper gives a detailed review of privacy-saving mechanisms in the cloud platform, such as statistical approaches like differential privacy and cryptographic solutions like homomorphic encryption. Federated analytics and federated learning, two distributed learning frameworks, are also discussed. Their principles, applications, benefits, and limitations are reviewed, with roles of use in the fields of healthcare, finance, IoT, and industrial cases. Comparative analyses measure trade-offs in security, efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, and investigations are done of emerging hybrid frameworks to provide better privacy protection. Critical issues, including computational overhead, privacy-utility trade-offs, standardization, adversarial threats, and cloud integration are also addressed. This review examines in detail the recent privacy-protecting approaches in cloud computation and offers scholars and practitioners crucial information on secure and effective solutions to data processing."}

To capture individual differences within each cluster, we propose an implicit preference learning mechanism that contrasts user-authored text with cluster-level generations, allowing the model to infer user-specific style preferences without manual annotation. At inference time, CARD injects personalization exclusively at decoding via lightweight user preference vectors and low-rank logit corrections, while keeping the base model frozen.

Adversarial Prompts Put LLM Defenses to the Test", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent secure code generation methods, using vulnerability-aware fine-tuning, prefix-tuning, and prompt optimization, claim to prevent LLMs from producing insecure code. However, their robustness under adversarial conditions remains untested, and current evaluations decouple security from functionality, potentially inflating reported gains. We present the first systematic adversarial audit of state-of-the-art secure code generation methods (SVEN, SafeCoder, PromSec). We subject them to realistic prompt perturbations such as paraphrasing, cue inversion, and context manipulation that developers might inadvertently introduce or adversaries deliberately exploit. To enable fair comparison, we evaluate all methods under consistent conditions, jointly assessing security and functionality using multiple analyzers and executable tests. Our findings reveal critical robustness gaps: static analyzers overestimate security by 7 to 21 times, with 37 to 60% of ``secure'' outputs being non-functional. Under adversarial conditions, true secure-and-functional rates collapse to 3 to 17%.

This paper proposes E\\-HiDNet, a unified hybrid deep probabilistic learning framework that integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to allow accurate prediction of the progression of the APT campaign. The deep learning component extracts hierarchical spatio\\-temporal representations from correlated alert sequences, while the HMM models latent attack stages and their stochastic transitions, allowing principled inference under uncertainty and partial observability. A modified Viterbi algorithm is introduced to handle incomplete observations, ensuring robust decoding under uncertainty.

Instead, they become more tempting as an attack vector for adversaries which can evade the state-of-the-art deep learning visual-based and other prevailing countermeasures. We introduce \"ALFA\", a safe-by-design approach, to mitigate Quishing and prevent everyone from accessing the post-scan harmful payload of fancy QR codes.

Afterwards, using this binary grid, our solution extracts the structural features of fancy QR code and predicts its legitimacy using a pre-trained model. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset (containing diverse variations of fancy QR codes) and achieve a FNR of 0.06% only. We also develop the mobile app to test the practical feasibility of our solution and provide a performance comparison of the app with the real-world QR readers. This comparison further highlights the classification reliability and detection accuracy of this solution in real-world environments."}

HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency.

We detail the processes of dataset preparation, fine-tuning, and synthetic data generation, along with implications for real-world applications in threat detection, forensic investigation, and attack analysis.\n  Experiments highlight challenges in prompt length distribution during domain-specific fine-tuning. Uneven prompt lengths limit the model's effective use of the context window, constraining local inference to 200-400 tokens despite hardware support for longer sequences. Chain-of-thought styled prompts, paired with quantized weights, yielded the best performance under these constraints. To address context limitations, we employed a hybrid strategy using cloud LLMs for synthetic data generation and local fine-tuning for deployment efficiency.\n  To extend the evaluation, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and graph-based reasoning framework. This approach enables structured alignment with MITRE ATT&CK techniques through STIX-based threat intelligence, enhancing recall in multi-hop and long-context scenarios.

To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-5 achieves a prominent 61.5% accuracy in main tasks, though a substantial gap relative to financial experts persists; in online tasks, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other commercial LLMs. Error analysis further identifies the specific capability deficiencies of existing models within practical financial business contexts.

Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \\SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \\SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute. This makes the model for private inference scale to 63$\\times$ larger while only having a 15.2$\\times$ increase in end-to-end runtime.

The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?\n  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.\n  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).\n  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease. These findings matter for practitioners: self-consistency is not universally beneficial, and teams should test their specific models before deployment. We release our code and provide practical recommendations for navigating these tradeoffs."}

We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations.

Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening. Furthermore, we conducted a survey with cybersecurity professionals to evaluate the generated analysis reports, identifying their key strengths and areas for improvement.

Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models.

To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities. While each approach has complementary failure modes, their combination enables reliable inference under sensor noise and missing data. We evaluate ConSensus on five diverse multimodal sensing benchmarks, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 7.1% over the single-agent baseline.

Unfortunately, existing MIA defenses, typically applied independently to each client in FL, are ineffective against powerful trajectory-based MIAs that exploit temporal information throughout the training process to infer membership status. In this paper, we investigate a new FL defense scenario driven by heterogeneous privacy needs and privacy-utility trade-offs, where only a subset of clients are defended, as well as a collaborative defense mode where clients cooperate to mitigate membership privacy leakage. To this end, we introduce CoFedMID, a collaborative defense framework against MIAs in FL, which limits local model memorization of training samples and, through a defender coalition, enhances privacy protection and model utility. Specifically, CoFedMID consists of three modules: a class-guided partition module for selective local training samples, a utility-aware compensation module to recycle contributive samples and prevent their overconfidence, and an aggregation-neutral perturbation module that injects noise for cancellation at the coalition level into client updates. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our defense framework significantly reduces the performance of seven MIAs while incurring only a small utility loss. These results are consistently verified across various defense settings."}

Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale."}

Despite being trained on large-scale, high-quality data, LLMs still fail to outperform traditional static analysis tools in specialized domains like smart contract vulnerability detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training algorithm based on atomic task decomposition and fusion. This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. On 31 real-world contracts, the algorithm achieves a 20% higher recall than traditional analysis tools."}

We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables. This work shows the potential of feedback-driven language agents as a new paradigm for generalizable and interpretable large-scale optimization."}

Consequently, security teams often rely on runtime observations collected from sandboxed executions to investigate suspicious third-party components. We present HeteroGAT-Rank, an industry-oriented runtime behavior mining system that supports analyst-in-the-loop supply chain threat investigation. The system models execution-time behaviors of OSS packages as lightweight heterogeneous graphs and applies attention-based graph learning to rank behavioral patterns that are most relevant for security analysis. Rather than aiming for fully automated detection, HeteroGAT-Rank surfaces actionable runtime signals - such as file, network, and command activities - to guide manual investigation and threat hunting. To operate at ecosystem scale, the system decouples offline behavior mining from online analysis and integrates parallel graph construction for efficient processing across multiple ecosystems. An evaluation on a large-scale OSS execution dataset shows that HeteroGAT-Rank effectively highlights meaningful and interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with real-world vulnerability and attack trends, supporting practical security workflows under realistic operational constraints."}

However, centralization creates a trust crisis where users must entrust cloud providers with sensitive digital memory data. We identify a core tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty: centralized memory systems enable efficient cross-agent collaboration but expose users' sensitive data to cloud provider risks, while private deployments provide security but limit collaboration. To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, \"Context from MemTrust\" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness. We believe that AI memory plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and collaboration of agents and AI tools. AI memory will become the foundational infrastructure for AI agents, and MemTrust serves as a universal trusted framework for AI memory systems, with the goal of becoming the infrastructure of memory infrastructure."}

Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments.

We developed a secret-sharing theory based on homomorphic matrix transformations for factorized permutations. The inverse matrix transformation for computing the shared secret is determined by secret parameters, which results in incompletely defined functionality and gives rise to a brute-force cryptanalysis problem. Randomization of session keys using a message hash and random parameters guarantees the uniqueness of each signature, even for identical messages. We employed a zero-knowledge authentication protocol to confirm knowledge of the shared secret, thereby protecting the verifier against unauthorized signature imposition. The LINEture cryptosystem is built on linear matrix algebra and does not rely on a computationally hard problem.

This creates a new attack surface: indirect prompt injection (IPI), where hidden instructions are planted in the corpora and hijack model behavior once retrieved. Previous studies have highlighted this risk but often avoid the hardest step: ensuring that malicious content is actually retrieved. In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.\n  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).\n  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow. We further evaluate several defenses and find that they are insufficient to prevent the retrieval of malicious text, highlighting retrieval as a critical open vulnerability."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining.

In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments."}

This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions."}

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP."}

In this work, we introduce MacPrompt, a novel black-box and cross-lingual attack that reveals previously overlooked vulnerabilities in T2I safety mechanisms. Unlike existing attacks that rely on synonym substitution or prompt obfuscation, MacPrompt constructs macaronic adversarial prompts by performing cross-lingual character-level recombination of harmful terms, enabling fine-grained control over both semantics and appearance. By leveraging this design, MacPrompt crafts prompts with high semantic similarity to the original harmful inputs (up to 0.96) while bypassing major safety filters (up to 100%). More critically, it achieves attack success rates as high as 92% for sex-related content and 90% for violence, effectively breaking even state-of-the-art concept removal defenses. These results underscore the pressing need to reassess the robustness of existing T2I safety mechanisms against linguistically diverse and fine-grained adversarial strategies."}

To investigate the safety of LLMs during FL, we conduct preliminary experiments to analyze potential attack surfaces and defensible characteristics from the perspective of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. We find two key properties of FL: 1) LLMs are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients in FL, and 2) LoRA weights exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that can be filtered through simple classifiers. Based on these properties, we propose Safe-FedLLM, a probe-based defense framework for federated LLMs, constructing defenses across three dimensions: Step-Level, Client-Level, and Shadow-Level. The core concept of Safe-FedLLM is to perform probe-based discrimination on the LoRA weights locally trained by each client during FL, treating them as high-dimensional behavioral features and using lightweight classification models to determine whether they possess malicious attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-FedLLM effectively enhances the defense capability of federated LLMs without compromising performance on benign data.

When adversarial instructions appear in user queries or externally retrieved content, models may override intended logic. Recent defenses rely on supervised fine-tuning with benign and malicious labels. Although these methods achieve high attack rejection rates, we find that they rely on narrow correlations in defense data rather than harmful intent, leading to systematic rejection of safe inputs. We analyze three recurring shortcut behaviors induced by defense fine-tuning. \\emph{Position bias} arises when benign content placed later in a prompt is rejected at much higher rates; across reasoning benchmarks, suffix-task rejection rises from below \\textbf{10\\%} to as high as \\textbf{90\\%}. \\emph{Token trigger bias} occurs when strings common in attack data raise rejection probability even in benign contexts; inserting a single trigger token increases false refusals by up to \\textbf{50\\%}. \\emph{Topic generalization bias} reflects poor generalization beyond the defense data distribution, with defended models suffering test-time accuracy drops of up to \\textbf{40\\%}. These findings suggest that current prompt-injection defenses frequently respond to attack-like surface patterns rather than the underlying intent. We introduce controlled diagnostic datasets and a systematic evaluation across two base models and multiple defense pipelines, highlighting limitations of supervised fine-tuning for reliable LLM security."}

While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success, it often suffers from high sample complexity, reward shaping difficulties, and produces opaque neural network policies that are hard to interpret or verify. Manual design, on the other hand, requires substantial domain expertise and struggles to scale across diverse tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary search can effectively synthesize interpretable control policies in the form of executable code. By treating policy synthesis as a code evolution problem, we harness the LLM's prior knowledge of programming patterns and control heuristics while employing evolutionary search to explore the solution space systematically. We implement our approach using EvoToolkit, a framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-driven evolution with customizable fitness evaluation. Our method iteratively evolves populations of candidate policy programs, evaluating them against task-specific objectives and selecting superior individuals for reproduction. This process yields compact, human-readable control policies that can be directly inspected, modified, and formally verified. This work highlights the potential of combining foundation models with evolutionary computation for synthesizing trustworthy control policies in autonomous systems.

However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks."}

Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence."}

We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem.

How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors.

Submitted to arXiv as a preprint", "summary": "Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms."}

While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists. The findings highlight the potential of culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance the contextual relevance, inclusivity, and effectiveness of AI-driven mental health interventions across African settings."}

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\\% and 52.5\\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents."}

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%."}

In contrast to operating system (OS) environments, where mature tools provide dynamic inspection and incident response, the pre-OS stage lacks practical mechanisms for real-time visibility and threat detection. We present Peacock, a modular framework that introduces integrity-assured monitoring and remote verification for the UEFI boot process. Peacock consists of three components: (i) a UEFI-based agent that records Boot and Runtime Service activity with cryptographic protection against tampering; (ii) a cross-platform OS Agent that extracts the recorded measurements and produces a verifiable attestation bundle using hardware-backed guarantees from the platform's trusted module; and (iii) a Peacock Server that verifies attestation results and exports structured telemetry for enterprise detection. Our evaluation shows that Peacock reliably detects multiple real-world UEFI bootkits, including Glupteba, BlackLotus, LoJax, and MosaicRegressor.

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability. Consequently, HRPO significantly reduces the compute requirements for solver training without compromising performance or stability.

The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\\% true-positive rate), and high delivery >99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency. These results show that protocol-aware MQTT filtering can be efficiently realized in the programmable data plane, providing a practical foundation for edge IoT security. Future work will validate the design on production P4 hardware and integrate machine learning--based threshold adaptation."}

Nonetheless, devising a computational method for automatically constructing a concept map from unstructured educational materials presents challenges due to the complexity and variability of educational content. We focus primarily on two challenges: (1) the lack of disciplinary concepts that are specifically designed for multi-level pedagogical purposes from low-order to high-order thinking, and (2) the limited availability of labeled data concerning disciplinary concepts and their interrelationships. To tackle these challenges, this research introduces an innovative approach for constructing Domain Question Maps (DQMs), rather than traditional concept maps. By formulating specific questions aligned with learning objectives, DQMs enhance knowledge representation and improve readiness for learner engagement. The findings indicate that the proposed method can effectively generate educational questions and discern hierarchical relationships among them, leading to structured question maps that facilitate personalized and adaptive learning in downstream applications."}

In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% with no loss-and in some cases, gains-in accuracy. Our approach offers a principled and efficient solution to reduce overthinking in LRMs, and provides a generalizable path toward redundancy-aware reasoning optimization."}

First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development.

Decentralized Applications (DApps) in distributed systems consist of on-chain and off-chain functions, where on-chain functions are smart contracts running in the blockchain network, while off-chain functions operate outside the blockchain. Since smart contracts cannot access off-chain information, they cannot verify whether the off-chain functions, i.e. the software components, they interact with have been tampered or not. As a result, establishing mutual trust between the on-chain smart contracts and the off-chain functions remains a significant challenge. To address the challenge, this paper introduces TeeMAF, a generic framework for mutual attestation between on-chain and off-chain functions, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), specifically Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), SCONE (a TEE container on top of Intel SGX), and remote attestation technologies. This ensures that the deployed off-chain functions of a DApp execute in a provably secure computing environment and achieve mutual attestation with the interacting on-chain functions. Through a security analysis of TeeMAF, the reliability of deployed DApps can be verified, ensuring their correct execution. Furthermore, based on this framework, this paper proposes a decentralized resource orchestration platform (a specific DApp) for deploying applications over untrusted environments. The system is implemented on Ethereum and benchmarked using Hyperledger Caliper. Performance evaluation focusing on throughput and latency demonstrates that, compared to platforms without a mutual attestation scheme, the performance overhead remains within an acceptable range."}

Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$.

Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents."}

We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning.

As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation."}

We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource-constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing complementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup."}

This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency. Across diverse domains, the model obtained via ARM merging outperforms prior model merging methods and domain-specific expert models, while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization."}

Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model.\n  In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.\n  This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation. Future systems will not only diagnose and remediate infrastructure failures, but also predict the impact of planned changes on services and customers, enabling operators to mitigate risks before executing maintenance operations."}

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.\n  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.\n  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence."}

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems."}

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning."}

To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset."}

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines."}

Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents."}

Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users.

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction."}

Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG.

In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration."}

LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible plans or silent contract violations, amplified by BOM coupling. We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation. A self-contained synthetic micro-benchmark (500 instances; T=5) computed by exact enumeration under an execution model with MOQ uplift and emergency purchases shows heavy-tailed regret and nontrivial MOQ-violation incidence for extraction-only planning, motivating verification as a first-class component of contract-grounded planning systems."}

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment. This transformation bridges the reasoning capability gap between deterministic automation and expert judgment, improving recall in repository-aware effort estimation."}

We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies.

Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively."}

While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites.

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation."}

A Factorial Analysis Methodology for Diagnosing the Trade-off between Preference Alignment and Real-World Validity", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \\times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness. These findings offer a novel, reproducible factorial evaluation methodology that provides finer-grained diagnostics for post-training processes like RLHF, enabling better trade-offs in the product iteration of LLMs by offering a more nuanced understanding of preference alignment risks and the impact of manipulative prompts."}

As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers.

We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization.

Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \\SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \\SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute.

Despite being trained on large-scale, high-quality data, LLMs still fail to outperform traditional static analysis tools in specialized domains like smart contract vulnerability detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training algorithm based on atomic task decomposition and fusion. This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. On 31 real-world contracts, the algorithm achieves a 20% higher recall than traditional analysis tools."}

However, centralization creates a trust crisis where users must entrust cloud providers with sensitive digital memory data. We identify a core tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty: centralized memory systems enable efficient cross-agent collaboration but expose users' sensitive data to cloud provider risks, while private deployments provide security but limit collaboration. To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, \"Context from MemTrust\" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness. We believe that AI memory plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and collaboration of agents and AI tools. AI memory will become the foundational infrastructure for AI agents, and MemTrust serves as a universal trusted framework for AI memory systems, with the goal of becoming the infrastructure of memory infrastructure."}

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%."}

Specifically, we integrate Gemini 2.0 Pro for logic-based vulnerability detection with the Avalanche C-Chain for tamper-evident artifact logging. Unlike fully decentralized solutions that suffer from high latency, Zer0n employs a hybrid architecture: execution remains off-chain for performance, while integrity proofs are finalized on-chain. Our evaluation on a dataset of 500 endpoints reveals that this approach achieves 80% detection accuracy with only a marginal 22.9% overhead, effectively demonstrating that decentralized integrity can coexist with high-speed security workflows."}

This creates a new attack surface: indirect prompt injection (IPI), where hidden instructions are planted in the corpora and hijack model behavior once retrieved. Previous studies have highlighted this risk but often avoid the hardest step: ensuring that malicious content is actually retrieved. In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.\n  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).\n  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow. We further evaluate several defenses and find that they are insufficient to prevent the retrieval of malicious text, highlighting retrieval as a critical open vulnerability."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining. To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a robust LLM-RL framework with HITL support for cloud defense. We will release our framework to the community, facilitating the advancement of robust and autonomous defense in cloud networks."}

Our analysis identifies three distinct development profiles: sustained, steady, and burst-driven. These profiles reflect substantial variation in ecosystem maturity. Perfective commits constitute 40.8% of all changes, suggesting that feature enhancement is prioritized over corrective maintenance (27.4%) and adaptive updates (24.3%). Data about issues shows that the most frequent concerns involve bugs (22%), infrastructure (14%), and agent coordination challenges (10%). Issue reporting also increased sharply across all frameworks starting in 2023. Median resolution times range from under one day to about two weeks, with distributions skewed toward fast responses but a minority of issues requiring extended attention.

Most prior work focuses on improving the training efficiency of federated LLMs. However, security in open environments is overlooked, particularly defenses against malicious clients. To investigate the safety of LLMs during FL, we conduct preliminary experiments to analyze potential attack surfaces and defensible characteristics from the perspective of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. We find two key properties of FL: 1) LLMs are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients in FL, and 2) LoRA weights exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that can be filtered through simple classifiers. Based on these properties, we propose Safe-FedLLM, a probe-based defense framework for federated LLMs, constructing defenses across three dimensions: Step-Level, Client-Level, and Shadow-Level. The core concept of Safe-FedLLM is to perform probe-based discrimination on the LoRA weights locally trained by each client during FL, treating them as high-dimensional behavioral features and using lightweight classification models to determine whether they possess malicious attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-FedLLM effectively enhances the defense capability of federated LLMs without compromising performance on benign data. Notably, our method effectively suppresses malicious data impact without significant impact on training speed, and remains effective even with many malicious clients.

When adversarial instructions appear in user queries or externally retrieved content, models may override intended logic. Recent defenses rely on supervised fine-tuning with benign and malicious labels. Although these methods achieve high attack rejection rates, we find that they rely on narrow correlations in defense data rather than harmful intent, leading to systematic rejection of safe inputs. We analyze three recurring shortcut behaviors induced by defense fine-tuning. \\emph{Position bias} arises when benign content placed later in a prompt is rejected at much higher rates; across reasoning benchmarks, suffix-task rejection rises from below \\textbf{10\\%} to as high as \\textbf{90\\%}. \\emph{Token trigger bias} occurs when strings common in attack data raise rejection probability even in benign contexts; inserting a single trigger token increases false refusals by up to \\textbf{50\\%}. \\emph{Topic generalization bias} reflects poor generalization beyond the defense data distribution, with defended models suffering test-time accuracy drops of up to \\textbf{40\\%}. These findings suggest that current prompt-injection defenses frequently respond to attack-like surface patterns rather than the underlying intent. We introduce controlled diagnostic datasets and a systematic evaluation across two base models and multiple defense pipelines, highlighting limitations of supervised fine-tuning for reliable LLM security."}

However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks."}

The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem.

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%."}

We demonstrate the effectiveness of IsabeLLM by using it to develop a novel model of Bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus protocol and verify its correctness. We use the DeepSeek R1 API for this demonstration and found that we were able to generate correct proofs for each of the non-trivial lemmas present in the verification."}
