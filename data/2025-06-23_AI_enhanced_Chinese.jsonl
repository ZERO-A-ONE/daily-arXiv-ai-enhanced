Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs,\nthe framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic\ninterpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning.\nETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between\ntransaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors.

However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal\nproblem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and\nleveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on\nvisual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and\ngenerate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal\nreasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding\nand capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key\ncomponents, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch\nvalidation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue\nreport, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code\nresponsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into\nexecutable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the\nvisual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of\nthe patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue,\nproviding feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M,\nand the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o\nas the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best\nopen-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the\nbase model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances,\noutperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances.

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

Results show that (1) simple static source code analysis can be an\nefficient and effective entry point for holistic TD discovery, (2) inadequate\ncommunication significantly contributes to TD, (3) misalignment between\narchitectural and organizational structures can exacerbate TD accumulation, (4)\nmicroservices can rapidly cycle through TD accumulation and resolution, a\nphenomenon referred to as \"microservice architecture technical debt gamble\".\nFinally, we identify a set of fitting strategies for TD management in\nmicroservice architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff08TD\uff09\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684TD\u53d1\u73b0\u5165\u53e3\uff0c\u6c9f\u901a\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267TD\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dTD\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u800c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6f14\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff08TD\uff09\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d28\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dTD\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u8ba8\u8bba\u53ca\u9996\u5e2d\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u8bbf\u8c08\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684TD\u53d1\u73b0\u5165\u53e3\uff1b\u6c9f\u901a\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267TD\uff1b\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u4e2dTD\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u5feb\u901f\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u8d4c\u535a\u201d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7684TD\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, previous works\nfocus on the specific field-embedding methods while lacking a consideration on\nrequired field-generation embedding. In this paper, we propose a generic\nblockchain-based steganography framework (GBSF). The sender generates the\nrequired fields such as amount and fees, where the additional covert data is\nembedded to enhance the channel capacity. Based on GBSF, we design a reversible\ngenerative adversarial network (R-GAN) that utilizes the generative adversarial\nnetwork with a reversible generator to generate the required fields and encode\nadditional covert data into the input noise of the reversible generator. We\nthen explore the performance flaw of R-GAN. To further improve the performance,\nwe propose R-GAN with Counter-intuitive data preprocessing and Custom\nactivation functions, namely CCR-GAN. The counter-intuitive data preprocessing\n(CIDP) mechanism is used to reduce decoding errors in covert data, while it\nincurs gradient explosion for model convergence. The custom activation function\nnamed ClipSigmoid is devised to overcome the problem. Theoretical justification\nfor CIDP and ClipSigmoid is also provided. We also develop a mechanism named\nT2C, which balances capacity and concealment. We conduct experiments using the\ntransaction amount of the Bitcoin mainnet as the required field to verify the\nfeasibility. We then apply the proposed schemes to other transaction fields and\nblockchains to demonstrate the scalability. Finally, we evaluate capacity and\nconcealment for various blockchains and transaction fields and explore the\ntrade-off between capacity and concealment.

Using Sotopia as a\nsimulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated\nhow personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated\nsocial negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of\napplications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.\nExperiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits\nimpact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness\nand Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and\nknowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from\nteam communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic\ncommunication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable\ninsights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes\noperational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by\nmanipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,\nspecifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent\ntrustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a\nrepeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability\nacross diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly\nsupporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems.

While individual requirements can usually be analyzed\nmanually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL\nrequirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers)\nmay efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical\nlimitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal\nconstraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal\nreasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings\nis less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies\nthe satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive\na satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to\ngenerate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used\nto validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the\nperformance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural\nlanguage into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for\nPython-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a\nconsistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements,\nleading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain\ncases compared to baselines without generated checkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff08SMT\u548cPython\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cdLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff0cPython\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u9700\u6c42\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Audit logs provide a detailed and chronological record of all\nactivities in the system. Unfortunately, K8s auditing suffers from several\npractical limitations: it generates large volumes of data continuously, as all\ncomponents within the cluster interact and respond to user actions. Moreover,\neach action can trigger a cascade of secondary events dispersed across the log,\nwith little to no explicit linkage, making it difficult to reconstruct the\ncontext behind user-initiated operations. In this paper, we introduce K8NTEXT,\na novel approach for streamlining K8s audit logs by reconstructing contexts,\ni.e., grouping actions performed by actors on the cluster with the subsequent\nevents these actions cause. Correlated API calls are automatically identified,\nlabeled, and consistently grouped using a combination of inference rules and a\nMachine Learning model, largely simplifying data consumption. We evaluate\nK8NTEXT's performance, scalability, and expressiveness both in systematic tests\nand with a series of use cases.

In\nparticular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level\nissue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been\nsignificant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving\nsuch issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately\nsuspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper\nunderstanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.\nConsequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user\nissue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,\ncode, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -\nidentifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through\na novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant\ncontext, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)\nisolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)\nleverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that\nproposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant\nfixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our\nmethodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark\nbeating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of\n7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.\nWe note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring\nmulti-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that\nincorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust\nand semantically consistent repairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u60c5\u51b5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "SemAgent\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u9694\u79bb\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u4fee\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWEBench-Lite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemAgent\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u8fbe\u523044.66%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u8865\u4e01\u3002"}}

These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT\nidentifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion\nin the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the\ninput. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an\nopposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal\nsignal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful\nattack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple\nsampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source\nGPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.\nBesides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against\npopular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBEAT\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u62fc\u63a5\u524d\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u9690\u79d8\u5730\u7834\u574fLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u5a01\u80c1\u66f4\u5927\u3002BEAT\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e6\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\u5728LLMaaS\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "BEAT\u5229\u7528\u62fc\u63a5\u89e6\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u62fc\u63a5\u524d\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBEAT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u548cLLM\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u95ed\u6e90\u7684GPT-3.5-turbo\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u521d\u6b65\u9632\u5fa1\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "BEAT\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684LLM\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002"}}

Pre-embedding these key\nconfigurations in the nodes would make the network inflexible. On the other\nhand, permitting subsets of nodes to engage in a common key synthesis phase to\ncreate secure distributed connections amongst themselves, would decouple and\nconceal the information flow from the controlling centre. An intermediate\nsolution is the notion of a centre driven key generation process through\nbroadcast tokens, designed to extract different keys in different nodes based\non some prior information stored at the nodes. As more tokens arrive, the\nvirtual connectivity of the nodes are altered and the network evolves.

Industry practitioners often lack clear guidelines and effective tools\nto integrate fairness testing into real-world AI development. This study\ninvestigates how software professionals test AI-powered systems for fairness\nthrough interviews with 22 practitioners working on AI and ML projects. Our\nfindings highlight a significant gap between theoretical fairness concepts and\nindustry practice. While fairness definitions continue to evolve, they remain\ndifficult for practitioners to interpret and apply. The absence of\nindustry-aligned fairness testing tools further complicates adoption,\nnecessitating research into practical, accessible solutions. Key challenges\ninclude data quality and diversity, time constraints, defining effective\nmetrics, and ensuring model interoperability. These insights emphasize the need\nto bridge academic advancements with actionable strategies and tools, enabling\npractitioners to systematically address fairness in AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c0822\u4f4d\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u4f46\u884c\u4e1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u878d\u5165\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u516c\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c0822\u4f4d\u4ece\u4e8bAI\u548cML\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u884c\u4e1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6307\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5c06\u5b66\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This is the basis for\none of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware\ndesigners to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally\n\"equivalent\" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This\nspecification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors\ngenerally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we\nadvocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement.\nWe introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient\nexecution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that\nubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for\ndecades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use\nnon-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is\nsingle specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional\ncorrectness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture.

This approach generates self-contained,\nsemantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving\nperformance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3\npoints on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.\nOur work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling\nretrieval-enhanced code intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08AST\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\\ourwork\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u57fa\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u57fa\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u5e38\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u89e3\u5927\u578bAST\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u5144\u5f1f\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728RepoEval\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dRecall@5\u63d0\u53474.3\u70b9\uff0c\u5728SWE-bench\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dPass@1\u63d0\u53472.67\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}
