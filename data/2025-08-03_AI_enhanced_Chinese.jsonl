Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger\ndata leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived\nsentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across\nmultiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel\nblack-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and\nstandard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous\nknowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that\ncreates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content.\nSpecifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information\ndisparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and\nsyntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature\nscores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike\nprior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative\nrefinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we\nachieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in\nmulti-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in\ncase studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG\nsystems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a\nfoundation for adaptive mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u53d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u5bf9\u6297\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc4\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u57df\u548c\u591a\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8691%\u548c83%\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u53d6\u7387\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u53e5\u5b50\u66b4\u9732\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8665%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

By correlating extracted\nfilenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware\ncampaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering\ninfection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence.

With the rapid advancement\nof large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in\naddressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have\nintroduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of\nLLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still\nface limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the\ncapacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their\noverall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first\nagent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.\nTrae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and\naddresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level\nunderstanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.\nWe conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted\nSWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art\nensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent\nconsistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of\n10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first\nplace on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of\n75.20%.

Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues.
