Generative AI tools are increasingly used in\ndevelopment workflows, but their suggestions often overlook dependency\nevaluation, emphasize popularity over suitability, and lack reproducibility.\nThis creates risks for projects that require transparency, long-term\nreliability, maintainability, and informed architectural decisions. This study\nformulates software package selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making\n(MCDM) problem and proposes a data-driven framework for technology evaluation.\nAutomated data pipelines continuously collect and integrate software metadata,\nusage trends, vulnerability information, and developer sentiment from GitHub,\nPyPI, and Stack Overflow. These data are structured into a decision model\nrepresenting relationships among packages, domain features, and quality\nattributes. The framework is implemented in PySelect, a decision support system\nthat uses large language models to interpret user intent and query the model to\nidentify contextually appropriate packages. The approach is evaluated using\n798,669 Python scripts from 16,887 GitHub repositories and a user study based\non the Technology Acceptance Model. Results show high data extraction\nprecision, improved recommendation quality over generative AI baselines, and\npositive user evaluations of usefulness and ease of use.

This study introduces a genetic\nalgorithm-based method for test input generation that innovatively integrates\ngenetic operators and adaptive learning to enhance software vulnerability\ndetection. A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator,\nwhich facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential\ntest inputs. Complementing this, an adaptive feedback mechanism continuously\nlearns from the system's execution behavior and dynamically guides input\ngeneration toward promising areas of the input space. Rather than relying on\nfixed or randomly selected inputs, the approach evolves a population of\nstructurally valid test cases using feedback-driven selection, enabling deeper\nand more effective code traversal. This strategic integration of exploration\nand exploitation ensures that both diverse and targeted test inputs are\ndeveloped over time.

Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher\noptimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining\nQwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\\% optimization success rate\nfor power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\\%) and even\ncommercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\\%).

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design.

However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat\nevent sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and\nmultiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that\ntransforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals,\nintroducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs\nMultivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal\nscales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral\nsequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are\nencoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,\nwhile the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match\nthe encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused\nto construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a\nmultilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection.

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be\nfleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a\nregulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having\n\"beliefs\" about its environment, which it \"updates\" in response to sensory\ninput. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

Our\nresults suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the\ndesign of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven\nresearch in social choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u516c\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u7406\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8865\u5145\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u516c\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u516c\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e3a\u65b0\u6295\u7968\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
