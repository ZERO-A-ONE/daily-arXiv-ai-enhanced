To enable\nrapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated\npipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use\nexecution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration\ntraditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,\nexecution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute\ngains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,\nNYU CTF Bench, and Cybench.

However, little is known about how open-source projects\nuse and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub\nprojects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method:\nWe conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub\nActions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using\nSonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud\nprojects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among\n265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default\nquality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to\npass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate\nprovided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with\ndifferent conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with\nSonarQube Cloud's \"Clean as You Code\" principle and enforce security,\nmaintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or\nmodified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined\nconfigurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to\nmeet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a\nfuture research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software\noutcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable\nevidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud\nin various contexts."}

Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific\nqueries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose\nUniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike\nprior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that\ncan simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics\nand domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such\nas directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,\nor launching denial-of-service attacks.

Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly\neffective and significantly outperforms baselines.

Each\nuser is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for\nimmediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought\nrationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored\nreinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge\ndistillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward\nshaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational\ncapabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling\ndynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on\nMovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves\nsubstantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite\nusing only 0.4% of the full training data."}

In\nthis work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple\ncollectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective\naction in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,\ni.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of\nthe features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We\nprovide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'\nsizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing\nprevious empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with\nmultiple collectives."}

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI)."}

We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE\nMapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques.

To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an\nautomated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of\nthree main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical\nway to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static\nindicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability\nmetrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,\nscenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific\nevaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.\nExperiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its\nautomated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's\nrho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in\ntravel planning).
