As a result, AI model\nstealing attacks pose a serious concern for AI model providers. In this work,\nwe present a novel attack targeting wireless devices equipped with AI hardware\naccelerators. The attack unfolds in two phases. In the first phase, the\nvictim's device is compromised with a hardware Trojan (HT) designed to covertly\nleak model weights through a hidden communication channel, without the victim\nrealizing it. In the second phase, the adversary uses a nearby wireless device\nto intercept the victim's transmission frames during normal operation and\nincrementally reconstruct the complete weight matrix. The proposed attack is\nagnostic to both the AI model architecture and the hardware accelerator used.\nWe validate our approach through a hardware-based demonstration involving four\ndiverse AI models of varying types and sizes. We detail the design of the HT\nand the covert channel, highlighting their stealthy nature. Additionally, we\nanalyze the impact of bit error rates on the reception and propose an error\nmitigation technique. The effectiveness of the attack is evaluated based on the\naccuracy of the reconstructed models with stolen weights and the time required\nto extract them. Finally, we explore potential defense mechanisms."}

However, to ensure data\navailability, current rollup protocols require the plaintext of executed\ntransactions to be published on-chain, resulting in inherent privacy\nlimitations.\n  In this paper, we address this problem by introducing Calyx, the first\nprivacy-preserving multi-token optimistic-Rollup protocol.

With the widespread distillation and deployment of large language\nmodels (LLMs) into single file .gguf formats, their weight spaces have become\nexposed to an unprecedented hardware attack surface. This paper is the first to\nsystematically discover and validate the existence of single-bit\nvulnerabilities in LLM weight files: in mainstream open-source models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek and QWEN) using .gguf quantized formats, flipping just single bit can\ninduce three types of targeted semantic level failures Artificial Flawed\nIntelligence (outputting factual errors), Artificial Weak Intelligence\n(degradation of logical reasoning capability), and Artificial Bad Intelligence\n(generating harmful content).\n  By building an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and a\nprobabilistic heuristic scanning framework called BitSifter, we achieved\nefficient localization of critical vulnerable bits in models with hundreds of\nmillions of parameters. Experiments show that vulnerabilities are significantly\nconcentrated in the tensor data region, particularly in areas related to the\nattention mechanism and output layers, which are the most sensitive. A negative\ncorrelation was observed between model size and robustness, with smaller models\nbeing more susceptible to attacks. Furthermore, a remote BFA chain was\ndesigned, enabling semantic-level attacks in real-world environments: At an\nattack frequency of 464.3 times per second, a single bit can be flipped with\n100% success in as little as 31.7 seconds.

In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nretrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code\nsearch results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse\nvs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations\nacross several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We\nfocus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be\nimplemented in any PLs.

While prior explainability methods like\nStateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain\nlimited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to\nmulti-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent\nCollaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that\nextends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.\nOur method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy\nexploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state\ninformation and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to\nperform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,\nreducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation\nfidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of\nour approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to\nmulti-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on\ntrajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable\nexplanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision\nprocesses. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent\nbenchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google\nResearch Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy\nrobustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations."}

Tendermint, a widely adopted consensus protocol in\nconsortium blockchains, achieves high throughput and finality. However,\nprevious analysis of the safety and termination has been done in a standalone\nfashion, with no consideration of the composition with other protocols\ninteracting with it in a concurrent manner. Moreover, the termination\nproperties under adaptive network delays caused by Byzantine adversaries have\nnot been formally analyzed. This paper presents the first universally\ncomposable (UC) security analysis of Tendermint, demonstrating its resilience\nagainst strategic message-delay attacks. By constructing a UC ideal model of\nTendermint, we formalize its core mechanisms: phase-base consensus procedure,\ndynamic timeouts, proposal locking, leader rotation, and others, under a\nnetwork adversary that selectively delays protocol messages. Our main result\nproves that the Tendermint protocol UC-realizes the ideal Tendermint model,\nwhich ensures bounded termination latency, i.e., guaranteed termination, even\nwhen up to $f<n/3$ nodes are Byzantine (where $n$ is the number of nodes\nparticipating in the consensus), provided that network delays remain within a\nprotocol-defined threshold under the partially synchronous net assumption.\nSpecifically, through formal proofs within the UC framework, we show that\nTendermint maintains safety and termination.

We frame this\nproblem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer\na specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,\nwe model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's\nmulti-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that\nseparates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To\nlearn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network\nthat couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both\nmodel routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates\nthat the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about\nmodel capabilities and query characteristics."}

As a result, AI model\nstealing attacks pose a serious concern for AI model providers. In this work,\nwe present a novel attack targeting wireless devices equipped with AI hardware\naccelerators. The attack unfolds in two phases. In the first phase, the\nvictim's device is compromised with a hardware Trojan (HT) designed to covertly\nleak model weights through a hidden communication channel, without the victim\nrealizing it. In the second phase, the adversary uses a nearby wireless device\nto intercept the victim's transmission frames during normal operation and\nincrementally reconstruct the complete weight matrix. The proposed attack is\nagnostic to both the AI model architecture and the hardware accelerator used.\nWe validate our approach through a hardware-based demonstration involving four\ndiverse AI models of varying types and sizes. We detail the design of the HT\nand the covert channel, highlighting their stealthy nature. Additionally, we\nanalyze the impact of bit error rates on the reception and propose an error\nmitigation technique. The effectiveness of the attack is evaluated based on the\naccuracy of the reconstructed models with stolen weights and the time required\nto extract them.
