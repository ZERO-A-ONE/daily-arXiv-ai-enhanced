Blockchains are distributed\nsystems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a\npublic, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in\nkind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions\netc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are\nlinked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total\nordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability\nto operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a\nblock are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks,\nthese resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently,\nfairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering. In\nnon-commercial networks, however, monetary solutions are not available, by\ndefinition. The present non-commercial blockchain networks employ trivial\ndistribution mechanisms called faucets, which offer fixed amounts of free\ntokens (called cryptocurrencies) specific to the given network. This mechanism,\nalthough simple and efficient, is prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks and\ncannot address the fairness problem. In the present dissertation, the faucet\nmechanism is adapted for fair distribution, in line with Max-min Fairness\nscheme.

As quantum computing\ntransitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present\nin classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited\nobservability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific\ntools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software\ndevelopers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews\nfocused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants\nreported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing\n(54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31%\nreported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual\nmethods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies,\nsuch as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which\nrespondents noted do not scale well.

Through extensive\nevaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used\nLLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge\nremoval.

However, in\nreal-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over\ntime, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient\ncharacteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.\nThese factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and\nincreasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This\nreview presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the\n\"health\" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for\ncontinuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective\nself-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of\nperformance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key\ntechniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at\nroot cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from\nmodel retraining to test-time adaptation.

Consequently,\ngenerating new datasets through code perturbation has become essential.\nHowever, existing methods often fail to produce complex and diverse variations,\nstruggle with complex cross-file dependencies, and lack support for multiple\nprogramming languages, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing LLM\nevaluations for coding tasks. To fill this gap, we propose CodeMorph, an\napproach designed to support multiple programming languages while preserving\ncross-file dependencies to mitigate data leakage. CodeMorph consists of two\nmain components that work together to enhance the perturbation process. The\nfirst component employs 26 semantic-preserving transformation methods to\niteratively perturb code, generating diverse variations while ensuring that the\nmodified code remains compilable. The second component introduces a genetic\nalgorithm-based selection algorithm, PESO, to identify the more effective\nperturbation method for each iteration by targeting lower similarity scores\nbetween the perturbed and original code, thereby enhancing overall perturbation\neffectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that after applying CodeMorph,\nthe accuracy of the LLM on code completion tasks across five programming\nlanguages decreased by an average of 24.67%, with Python showing the most\nsignificant reduction at 45%.

To further broaden real-world applications,\nmainstream team workspaces platforms, such as Google Workspace and Microsoft\nOneDrive, allow third-party applications (referred to as add-ons) to be\nintegrated into their workspaces, significantly extending the functionality of\nteam workspaces. The powerful multi-user collaboration capabilities and\nintegration of add-ons make team workspaces a central hub for managing shared\nresources and protecting them against unauthorized access. Due to the\ncollaboration features of team workspaces, add-ons involved in collaborations\nmay bypass the permission isolation enforced by the administrator, unlike in\nsingle-user permission management.\n  This paper aims to investigate the permission management landscape of team\nworkspaces add-ons. To this end, we perform an in-depth analysis of the\nenforced access control mechanism inherent in this ecosystem, considering both\nmulti-user and cross-app features. We identify three potential security risks\nthat can be exploited to cause permission escalation. We then systematically\nreveal the landscape of permission escalation risks in the current ecosystem.\nSpecifically, we propose an automated tool, TAI, to systematically test all\npossible interactions within this ecosystem.

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Infrastructures, represented by Deep Learning\n(DL) frameworks, have served as fundamental DL systems over the last decade.\nHowever, the bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in\nsome critical scenarios (e.g., healthcare and autonomous driving). A simple yet\neffective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing).\nUnfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered\nmultiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a\ncoarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to\nwhether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language\nModels (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only\nfocus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to\nanalyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test\ncases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven\nfuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents,\nnamely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis\nsummaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates\ntests guided by these analysis summaries. So far, FUEL has detected 104 bugs\nfor PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 47 already fixed,\nand 5 assigned with CVE IDs. Our work indicates that considering multiple types\nof feedback is beneficial to fuzzing performance, and leveraging LLMs to\nanalyze feedback information is a promising direction.

As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing\ninterest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving.

However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,\nfrom knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight\nthe importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately\nconstruct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'\nperformance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative\nmeasurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it\nto solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess\nsubstantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this\nknowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback\nfrom the CTF environment.\n  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a\nnovel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving.

The seven agents produced a total of 769 failed\npatches for those issues, which we checked with a combination of GPT-4o and\nmanual analysis. We present a taxonomy of the failure reasons across the\npatches. The taxonomy contains six categories, with several sub-categories\nunder each category. For example, a frequently observed category is the\ninability of an LLM to correctly infer/produce the appropriate variable type in\nthe produced patch. As a first step towards addressing such type-related\nerrors, we designed PAGENT (Patch Agent). PAGENT utilizes program analysis\ntechniques like CFG creation and exploration to infer the type of information\nof a patch. PAGENT does this by applying repository-level static code analysis\ntechniques. Then, PAGENT refines the inferred type by further utilizing an\nLLM-based inference technique. We tested PAGENT on all 127 type-related failed\npatches from the top three agents in our study. PAGENT could fix 29 of the 127\nfailed patches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5de5\u5177PAGENT\u6765\u4fee\u590d\u7c7b\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u5931\u8d25\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u6839\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6114\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790769\u4e2a\u5931\u8d25\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1PAGENT\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4fee\u590d\u7c7b\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "PAGENT\u6210\u529f\u4fee\u590d\u4e86127\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u5931\u8d25\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u768429\u4e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "PAGENT\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u7c7b\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm.

However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor\nscenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what\nmakes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel\nConstrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility\nof untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks.

To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled\nflexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with\nflipped one-hot labels.

While recent work in AI safety\nand mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,\nthey often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for\nother technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render\ndifferent alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting\nalignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in\nterms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according\nto which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the\npotential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI\nsystems.

In particular,\nreachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS)\nprojects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call\ngraphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis\ntypically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from\ndownstream applications. However, such crucial information is usually\nunavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly\nextracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive,\npatches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that\nover 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply\nignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming\nnoises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code. Given that almost\nhalf of the vulnerabilities are equipped with patches, a holistic solution that\nhandles both scenarios with and without patches is required. To meet real-world\nneeds and automatically localize VF, we present VFArch\\=e, a dual-mode approach\ndesigned for disclosed vulnerabilities, applicable in scenarios with or without\navailable patch links. The experimental results of VFArch\\=e on our constructed\nbenchmark dataset demonstrate significant efficacy regarding three metrics,\nachieving 1.3x and 1.9x Mean Reciprocal Rank over the best baselines for\nPatch-present and Patch-absent modes, respectively.

This\npaper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that\nenhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four\nspecialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query\nGeneration Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval\nAgent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for\nsynthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.\nEvaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system\nachieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods.

Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine\nlearning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by\nranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a\nlarge-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges\n(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M\nstructural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top\ncandidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,\nreducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that\nlearning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph\nconstruction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link\nprediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRAPHIA\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u8fdbJavaScript\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u6790\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709JavaScript\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\u65e2\u4e0d\u5065\u5168\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u9057\u6f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5168\u7a0b\u5e8f\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cJavaScript\u5e93\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cGRAPHIA\u572842%\u7684\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c72%\u6392\u540d\u524d\u4e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0cGRAPHIA\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06GNN\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6587\u4ef6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u56fe\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment.

Yet, despite their\nsystemic importance, a comprehensive and risk-oriented understanding of crucial\naspects like their design trade-offs, security dynamics, and interdependent\nfailure pathways often remains underdeveloped. This SoK confronts this gap\nthrough a large-scale analysis of 157 research studies, 95 active stablecoins,\nand 44 major security incidents. Our analysis establishes four pivotal\ninsights: 1) stability is best understood not an inherent property but an\nemergent, fragile state reliant on the interplay between market confidence and\ncontinuous liquidity; 2) stablecoin designs demonstrate trade-offs in risk\nspecialization instead of mitigation; 3) the widespread integration of yield\nmechanisms imposes a \"dual mandate\" that creates a systemic tension between the\ncore mission of stability and the high-risk financial engineering required for\ncompetitive returns; and 4) major security incidents act as acute \"evolutionary\npressures\", forging resilience by stress-testing designs and aggressively\nredefining the security frontier.

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable\nlimitations.

Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks.

Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative\nLLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative\nrefinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate\nsemantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting\ncomprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its\nrefinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within\nthis iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a\nrobust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.\nExtensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1\nimprovements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProperty-Generated Solver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08PBT\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff08TDD\uff09\u5728LLMs\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff1aGenerator\u8d1f\u8d23\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0cTester\u7ba1\u7406PBT\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cpass@1\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5bf9TDD\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8623.1%\u81f337.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "Property-Generated Solver\u901a\u8fc7PBT\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,\nstudies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these\nupdates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to\nreduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve\nenergy efficiency.

A typical scenario involves scammers deploying\nhoneypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and\ndraining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens.

However, real-world Rug\nPull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and\nsuspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one\naspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively.\n  In this paper, we propose RPhunter, a novel technique that integrates code\nand transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPhunter establishes declarative\nrules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further\nconstructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage\ntransaction information, RPhunter formulates dynamic token transaction\nactivities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are\ncharacterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives.\nFinally, RPhunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary\nfeatures from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model\nto enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull\nincidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth\ndataset.

Paillier algorithm allows addition and scalar\nmultiplication operations in dencrypted state, which can effectively protect\nprivacy. However, its computational efficiency is limited by complex modulo\noperations due to the ciphertext expansion followed by encryption. To\naccelerate its decryption operation, the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is\noften used to optimize these modulo operations, which lengthens the decryption\ncomputation chain in turn. To address this issue, we propose an eCRT-Paillier\ndecryption algorithm that shortens the decryption computation chain by\ncombining precomputed parameters and eliminating extra judgment operations\nintroduced by Montgomery modular multiplications. These two improvements reduce\n50% modular multiplications and 60% judgment operations in the postprocessing\nof the CRT-Paillier decryption algorithm. Based on these improvements, we\npropose a highly parallel full-pipeline architecture to eliminate stalls caused\nby multiplier reuse in traditional modular exponentiation operations. This\narchitecture also adopts some optimizations such as simplifying modular\nexponentiation units by dividing the exponent into segments and parallelizing\ndata flow by multi-core instantiation.

This paper solves that twin crisis\nof security and interoperability by re-imagining key management as a\nplatform-level service anchored in ARM TrustZone through OP-TEE. Our\narchitecture fractures the traditional monolithic Trusted Application into\nper-chain modules housed in a multi-tenant TA store, finally breaking OP-TEE's\nsingle-binary ceiling. A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air\npipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap\nupdates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries\na chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised\nsupply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS\ngatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and\nGP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or\ntiming domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via\nhardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to\nmalware in Android space.

Our\nthreat analysis spans six adversary layers and shows how the design neutralizes\nREE malware sniffing, OTA injection, and cross-module side channels without\nexotic hardware. A reference implementation on AOSP exports a Wallet Manager\nHAL, custom SELinux domains, and a CI/CD pipeline that vet community modules\nbefore release. The result is not merely another hardware wallet but a\nprogrammable substrate that can evolve at the velocity of the blockchain\necosystem. By welding radical extensibility to hardware-anchored assurance, the\nplatform closes the security-usability gap that has long stymied mass-market\nself-custody.

While recent work has\nshown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction\nattacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been\nsystematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a\nnetwork's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the\nmodel works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate\nsystem. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from\nscratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is\nprivate and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious\nserver), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and\nattention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits.

Private inference has focused on networks with\ndense inputs such as image classification, and less attention has been given to\nnetworks with sparse features. Unlike dense inputs, sparse features require\nefficient encrypted lookup operations into large embedding tables, which\npresent computational and memory constraints for FHE.\n  In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities when applying FHE\nto Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) from both a compiler and systems\nperspective. DLRMs utilize conventional MLPs for dense features and embedding\ntables to map sparse, categorical features to dense vector representations. We\ndevelop novel methods for performing compressed embedding lookups in order to\nreduce FHE computational costs while keeping the underlying model performant.\nOur embedding lookup improves upon a state-of-the-art approach by $77 \\times$.\nFurthermore, we present an efficient multi-embedding packing strategy that\nenables us to perform a 44 million parameter embedding lookup under FHE.\nFinally, we integrate our solutions into the open-source Orion framework and\npresent HE-LRM, an end-to-end encrypted DLRM. We evaluate HE-LRM on UCI (health\nprediction) and Criteo (click prediction), demonstrating that with the right\ncompression and packing strategies, encrypted inference for recommendation\nsystems is practical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08FHE\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLRM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u627e\u548c\u591a\u5d4c\u5165\u6253\u5305\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edfHE-LRM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1FHE\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982DLRM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u627e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11FHE\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5d4c\u5165\u6253\u5305\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6Orion\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86HE-LRM\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u627e\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8677\u500d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864400\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u627e\u3002HE-LRM\u5728UCI\u548cCriteo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6253\u5305\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)\nand supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of\nstate changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct\ndetection decisions.

We frame\nthe problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of\nseveral adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail\nbooking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,\nnearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate\nindividual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to\nmedication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of\nlongitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny\nCounty in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence\nadvances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies\nconfirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their\nremoval amplifies the estimated effects.

Currently, high-quality verifiers are\neither unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).\nWhile LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose\nverifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle\nverifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we\nintroduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining\nmultiple weak, imperfect verifiers.

Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics\nto normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers.

Two\nmajor limitations of current manual dataset construction are (1)\nlabor-intensive and error-prone annotation processes limiting the scale,\nquality, and evolution of the dataset, and (2) absence of standardized\nclassification rules results in inconsistent vulnerability categories and\nlabeling results across different datasets. To address these limitations, we\npresent FORGE, the first automated approach for constructing smart contract\nvulnerability datasets. FORGE leverages an LLM-driven pipeline to extract\nhigh-quality vulnerabilities from real-world audit reports and classify them\naccording to the CWE, the most widely recognized classification in software\nsecurity. FORGE employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to extract structured and\nself-contained vulnerability information from these reports. Additionally, it\nuses a tree-of-thoughts technique to classify the vulnerability information\ninto the hierarchical CWE classification. To evaluate FORGE's effectiveness, we\nrun FORGE on 6,454 real-world audit reports and generate a dataset comprising\n81,390 solidity files and 27,497 vulnerability findings across 296 CWE\ncategories.

Although\npredictive AI can process large alert volumes and identify known patterns, it\nstruggles with novel and evolving scenarios that demand contextual\nunderstanding and nuanced judgement. A promising solution is Human-AI teaming\n(HAT), which combines human expertise with AI's computational capabilities.\nLearning to Defer (L2D) operationalises HAT by enabling AI to \"defer\" uncertain\nor unfamiliar cases to human experts. However, traditional L2D models rely on\nstatic deferral policies that do not evolve with experience, limiting their\nability to learn from human feedback and adapt over time. To overcome this, we\nintroduce Learning to Defer with Human Feedback (L2DHF), an adaptive deferral\nframework that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(DRLHF) to optimise deferral decisions.

This property, known as adversarial transferability,\ncomplicates defense strategies since it enables black-box attacks to succeed\nwithout direct access to the victim model. While adversarial training is one of\nthe most widely adopted defense mechanisms, its effectiveness is typically\nevaluated on a narrow and homogeneous population of models. This limitation\nhinders the generalizability of empirical findings and restricts practical\nadoption.\n  In this work, we introduce DUMBer, an attack framework built on the\nfoundation of the DUMB (Dataset soUrces, Model architecture, and Balance)\nmethodology, to systematically evaluate the resilience of adversarially trained\nmodels.

However, the open wireless\nenvironment exposes AmBC systems to various attacks, and existing\nauthentication methods cannot be implemented between resource-constrained\nbackscatter devices (BDs) due to their high computational demands.To this end,\nthis paper proposes PLCRA-BD, a novel physical layer challenge-response\nauthentication scheme between BDs in AmBC that overcomes BDs' limitations,\nsupports high mobility, and performs robustly against impersonation and\nwireless attacks. It constructs embedded keys as physical layer fingerprints\nfor lightweight identification and designs a joint transceiver that integrates\nBDs' backscatter waveform with receiver functionality to mitigate interference\nfrom ambient RF signals by exploiting repeated patterns in OFDM symbols. Based\non this, a challenge-response authentication procedure is introduced to enable\nlow-complexity fingerprint exchange between two paired BDs leveraging channel\ncoherence, while securing the exchange process using a random number and\nunpredictable channel fading.

DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups\nand dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these\ngroups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these\ngroups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group\nconsistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.\nSimultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral\nstrategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.\nCrucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad\napplicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in\nvarious grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly\nenhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task\nspecialization, yielding substantial performance improvements.

While these attacks have been extensively studied,\ncurrent research predominantly focuses on analyzing each attack type\nindividually.

In this paper, we take the first step in studying the\nstrategic interactions among different attacks, which we define as attack\ncompositions. Specifically, we focus on four well-studied attacks during the\nmodel's inference phase: adversarial examples, attribute inference, membership\ninference, and property inference. To facilitate the study of their\ninteractions, we propose a taxonomy based on three stages of the attack\npipeline: preparation, execution, and evaluation. Using this taxonomy, we\nidentify four effective attack compositions, such as property inference\nassisting attribute inference at its preparation level and adversarial examples\nassisting property inference at its execution level. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the attack compositions using three ML model architectures and\nthree benchmark image datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof these four attack compositions. We implement and release a modular reusable\ntoolkit, COAT.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.

Existing literature\non improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such\nas prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the\npromising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by\nintervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the\nquery by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not\nundermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can\neffectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance\nwell.

Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer\nprobing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by\nsteering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior.
