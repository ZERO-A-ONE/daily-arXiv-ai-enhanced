### [1] [FormalGrad: Integrating Formal Methods with Gradient-Based LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10059)
*Yueke Zhang,Yifan Zhang,Kevin Leach,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FormalGrad框架通过将形式化方法集成到LLM代码生成循环中，生成更正确、鲁棒和高效的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的代码缺乏正确性、鲁棒性和效率保证的问题，特别是在严格约束的领域。

Method: 将代码视为可微分变量，将结构化反馈和形式约束转化为文本伪梯度，指导模型迭代优化解决方案。

Result: 在HumanEval、HumanEval+和LiveCodeBench基准测试中表现优异，绝对提升达27%，相对提升达41%。

Conclusion: FormalGrad为高风险应用中的可靠AI辅助软件开发提供了新途径。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

### [2] [SaraCoder: Orchestrating Semantic and Structural Cues for Profit-Oriented Repository-Level Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10068)
*Xiaohan Chen,Zhongying Pan,Quan Feng,Yu Tian,Shuqun Yang,Mengru Wang,Lina Gong,Yuxia Geng,Piji Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Saracoder是一种层次特征优化的检索框架，通过多维度优化检索结果，显著提升了代码补全的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本相似性的检索增强生成方法存在语义误导、冗余和同质化问题，且无法解决外部符号歧义。

Method: Saracoder包含层次特征优化模块（提取深层语义关系、去重、基于图的结构相似性评估）和外部感知标识符消歧模块（依赖分析）。

Result: 在CrossCodeEval和RepoEval-Updated基准测试中，Saracoder显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 多维度系统化优化检索结果为构建更准确、鲁棒的代码补全系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

### [3] [Next Edit Prediction: Learning to Predict Code Edits from Context and Interaction History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10074)
*Ruofan Lu,Yintong Huo,Meng Zhang,Yichen Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Next Edit Prediction”的新任务，旨在通过开发者最近的交互历史预测其下一步编辑的位置和内容，以优化代码编辑体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI编码助手（如低延迟代码补全和基于聊天的编辑）存在局限性，无法主动预测开发者的一系列相关编辑，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 研究者构建了一个高质量的有监督微调数据集和评估基准，并对一系列模型进行了微调和全面评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，微调后的模型在预测开发者下一步编辑方面表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为一种新的交互范式奠定了基础，能够通过预测开发者行为主动协作，而非仅响应显式指令。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

### [4] [On the synchronization between Hugging Face pre-trained language models and their upstream GitHub repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10157)
*Ajibode Adekunle,Abdul Ali Bangash,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了预训练语言模型（PTLM）在GitHub（GH）和Hugging Face（HF）平台上的开发协调问题，揭示了八种同步模式及其对模型发布的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTLM的开发涉及GH和HF两个平台，但跨平台协调存在时间线不一致、版本管理混乱等问题，可能导致用户获取不完整或过时的模型。

Method: 通过混合方法研究325个PTLM家族（904个HF变体），分析提交活动的协调方式，重点关注延迟、同步类型和强度三个维度。

Result: 发现GH贡献者主要优化代码和性能，HF贡献者改进模型描述和数据处理；八种同步模式中，部分同步模式（如分散同步和稀疏同步）占主导，显示跨平台发布的结构性脱节。

Conclusion: 识别同步模式对提升PTLM发布流程的透明度和可追溯性至关重要，需改进跨平台协调以避免用户获取不一致或过时的模型。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

### [5] [Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517)
*Likai Ye,Mengliang Li,Dehai Zhao,Jiamou Sun,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了Solidity版本更新带来的编译错误挑战，评估了LLMs在解决这些问题中的表现，并提出了SMCFIXER框架，显著提升了修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solidity频繁版本更新导致编译错误和迁移问题，亟需有效解决方案。

Method: 通过实证研究分析Solidity版本迁移中的错误，评估LLMs的修复能力，并开发SMCFIXER框架整合专家知识和LLM修复机制。

Result: 81.68%的合约在不同版本编译时出错；SMCFIXER比GPT-4o基线提升24.24%，达到96.97%准确率。

Conclusion: SMCFIXER框架显著提升了Solidity编译错误的修复效果，凸显领域特定适配的重要性。

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on
real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

### [6] [EVOSCAT: Exploring Software Change Dynamics in Large-Scale Historical Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10852)
*Souhaila Serbout,Diana Carolina Muñoz Hurtado,Hassan Atwi,Edoardo Riggio,Cesare Pautasso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoScat是一个工具，通过交互式密度散点图提供大型历史数据集的全局概览，帮助研究人员探索和比较软件演化数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期软件项目包含大量不断修订的工件，研究软件演化的研究人员需要处理数百万事件的数据集，EvoScat旨在解决时间可扩展性问题。

Method: EvoScat使用交互式密度散点图，支持灵活配置时间轴缩放、对齐、工件排序和交互式颜色映射，以分析数百万事件。

Result: 工具展示了如何适应特定分析需求（如变化速度比较、克隆检测、新鲜度评估），并提供了多个数据集示例。

Conclusion: EvoScat为研究人员提供了一种可扩展的可视化方法，帮助分析和比较软件演化数据。

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.

### [7] [A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10017)
*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合联邦学习（FL）和差分隐私（DP）解决医疗数据中的隐私与临床效用之间的权衡问题，并通过优化算法和数据处理方法提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据通常存在严重的类别不平衡和隐私问题，传统方法难以在保护隐私的同时保持临床效用。

Method: 研究采用多阶段分析，结合SMOTETomek技术和优化的FedProx算法，处理非独立同分布（non-IID）数据。

Result: 优化后的FedProx算法在隐私预算（epsilon）与模型召回率之间表现出非线性权衡，并在epsilon为9.0时实现高临床效用（召回率>77%）。

Conclusion: 研究为开发安全、有效的医疗诊断工具提供了实用的方法论框架。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

### [9] [Context Misleads LLMs: The Role of Context Filtering in Maintaining Safe Alignment of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10031)
*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context Filtering的防御机制，通过过滤不可信上下文来保护大语言模型免受越狱攻击，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型面临越狱攻击的安全和伦理风险，现有防御方法可能损害模型的实用性。

Method: 采用输入预处理方法，过滤不可信上下文并识别用户真实意图。

Result: 攻击成功率降低88%，同时保持模型性能，达到最佳安全与实用性平衡。

Conclusion: 该模型是一种即插即用方法，适用于所有大语言模型，无需微调即可提升安全性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

### [10] [Cognitive Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence: Guardrail Engineering with CCS-7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10033)
*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出CCS-7分类法，揭示语言模型存在类似人类的认知漏洞，并通过实验验证了不同架构模型对干预措施的响应差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的认知漏洞及其对齐问题，以提升认知安全性。

Method: 提出CCS-7分类法，进行人类对照实验（TFVA干预），并在12,180次实验中评估不同语言模型架构的响应。

Result: 人类表现稳定提升，而模型响应因架构而异，部分漏洞缓解，部分恶化（错误率最高增加135%）。

Conclusion: 认知安全需针对模型架构定制干预措施，强调部署前需进行架构感知测试。

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

### [11] [Neural Network-Based Detection and Multi-Class Classification of FDI Attacks in Smart Grid Home Energy Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10035)
*Varsha Sen,Biswash Basnet*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于检测和分类智能电网中的虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs），通过轻量级人工神经网络（ANN）和双向LSTM模型实现实时检测和攻击分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs）对智能电网基础设施构成严重威胁，尤其是家庭区域网络（HANs），因其安全性较弱且广泛可用，成为攻击者的目标。这些攻击会破坏智能电表数据的完整性，影响电网运行。

Method: 使用轻量级ANN进行实时检测，提取能源消耗、成本和时间等关键特征；采用双向LSTM分类不同攻击类型（如正常、梯形和S形攻击）。实验基于合成的家庭行为时间序列数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提模型能有效识别和分类FDIAs，为增强电网边缘弹性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建智能、数据驱动的防御机制提供了基础，有助于从住宅端点加强智能电网的网络安全。

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

### [12] [Certifiably robust malware detectors by design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10038)
*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型架构ERDALT，用于设计可证明鲁棒的恶意软件检测方法，并在不显著降低检测性能的情况下实现鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态恶意软件分析依赖机器学习技术，但易受对抗样本攻击，需要在不改变软件功能的情况下实现鲁棒检测。

Method: 提出了一种新的模型架构，将鲁棒检测器分解为特定结构，并基于此结构开发了框架ERDALT。

Result: 验证了该方法在机器学习恶意软件检测中的有效性，实现了鲁棒检测且性能损失有限。

Conclusion: ERDALT框架为恶意软件检测提供了一种可证明鲁棒的方法，适用于脆弱特征。

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CEMA是一种黑盒多任务文本对抗攻击方法，利用跨任务对抗文本的迁移性，通过少量查询实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖共享内部特征和大量查询，难以应对黑盒API、有限查询或多任务场景。

Method: 使用深度级替代模型，以即插即用方式训练，生成多对抗候选并选择最有效的。

Result: 在2-6个任务的多任务模型中，仅需100次查询即可成功攻击，适用于商业API和大模型。

Conclusion: CEMA在现实场景中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于区块链的联邦学习数据投毒检测框架（\Sys），通过分散全局服务器角色和引入共识验证的法官模型，提高了检测的鲁棒性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽保护了用户隐私，但易受数据投毒攻击影响，现有检测方法缺乏标准化或过度依赖信任。

Method: 提出\Sys框架，将全局服务器角色分散到客户端，并引入由客户端生成并通过共识验证的法官模型来检测投毒。

Result: 实验表明\Sys能有效抵御数据投毒攻击，且法官模型的生成具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: \Sys为联邦学习中的数据投毒问题提供了一种去中心化、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is

TL;DR: MAESTRO框架通过七层威胁建模架构，揭示了LLM与自主代理结合时的安全漏洞，并提出了多层防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决LLM与自主代理在网络监控和决策系统中结合时引发的严重安全问题。

Method: 使用MAESTRO框架构建原型代理系统，包括推理、内存、参数调优和异常检测模块，并通过Python、LangChain和WebSockets实现。

Result: 确认了两类威胁：资源拒绝服务和内存污染，导致性能下降。建议采用多层防御策略。

Conclusion: MAESTRO在威胁映射和弹性系统设计中有效，强调了内存完整性和跨层通信保护的重要性。

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对能源管理系统（EMS）的安全框架，结合生成式AI和多模态分析，有效应对网络安全漏洞和系统问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代能源管理系统面临复杂的网络安全威胁和系统问题，需要一种综合性的解决方案来识别和应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出多点攻击/错误模型，结合生成式AI异常检测系统和多模态分析框架（SoM-GI），整合视觉标记与规则。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统上验证了框架的有效性，能够识别数值方法无法检测的视觉异常。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合数值分析和视觉模式识别，为EMS提供了全面的安全保护。

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic
network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with
lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers:
autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the
complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and
practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network
environments and threat scenarios. Github link:

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用数字水印技术改进机器遗忘（MU）的新方法Water4MU，通过双层优化框架提升遗忘效果，并在图像分类和生成任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着被遗忘权需求的增加，机器遗忘成为提升信任和合规性的重要工具，但现有方法主要依赖模型权重调整，缺乏对数据层面调整的探索。

Method: 提出Water4MU框架，结合数字水印技术，通过双层优化（BLO）优化水印网络以降低遗忘难度，同时独立训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，Water4MU在图像分类和生成任务中有效，尤其在“挑战性遗忘”场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Water4MU为机器遗忘提供了一种数据层面的优化方法，显著提升了遗忘效果和模型实用性。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式数字身份架构，用于物理世界交易，解决了集中式身份管理的隐私和可用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式身份管理存在单点故障和隐私风险，需要一种去中心化的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种结合传感器、身份机构、属性验证器和个人身份代理（PIA）的分布式架构，并提出了首个协议。

Result: 协议通过形式化验证满足安全属性，概念验证显示架构和协议在几秒延迟内可行。

Conclusion: 分布式数字身份架构在物理世界交易中具有实际可行性，尤其适用于容忍几秒延迟的应用。

Abstract: Digital identities are increasingly important for mediating not only digital
but also physical service transactions. Managing such identities through
centralized providers can cause both availability and privacy concerns: single
points of failure and control are ideal targets for global attacks on
technical, organizational, or legal fronts. We design, analyze, and build a
distributed digital identity architecture for physical world transactions in
common scenarios like unlocking doors, public transport, or crossing country
borders. This architecture combines (biometric and other) sensors, (established
and upcoming) identity authorities, attribute verifiers, and a new core
component we call the \emph{Personal Identity Agent (PIA)} that represents
individuals with their identity attributes in the digital domain. All
transactions are conducted in a completely decentralized manner, and the
components for which we currently assume central coordination are optional and
only used for assisting with service discovery and latency reduction. We
present a first protocol between these parties and formally verify that it
achieves relevant security properties based on a realistic threat model
including strong global adversaries. A proof-of-concept implementation
demonstrates practical feasibility of both architecture and initial protocol
for applications that can tolerate end-to-end latencies in the range of a few
seconds.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MineDetect是一个联邦学习防御框架，用于地下采矿中检测和隔离受攻击模型，同时减少低质量数据的影响，提高安全性和操作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下采矿依赖传感器网络收集数据，但传输原始数据存在隐私风险。联邦学习（FL）虽能保护数据本地化，但仍面临模型被攻击和低质量数据的挑战。

Method: 提出MineDetect框架，通过历史感知机制检测受攻击模型，并消除不可靠模型对FL训练的影响。

Result: 在多样数据集上的仿真表明，MineDetect在鲁棒性和准确性上优于现有方法，尤其在非独立同分布数据场景中。

Conclusion: MineDetect通过对抗攻击和低质量数据的双重防御，显著提升了地下采矿的安全性和操作效率。

Abstract: Underground mining operations rely on distributed sensor networks to collect
critical data daily, including mine temperature, toxic gas concentrations, and
miner movements for hazard detection and operational decision-making. However,
transmitting raw sensor data to a central server for training deep learning
models introduces significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive
mine-specific information. Federated Learning (FL) offers a transformative
solution by enabling collaborative model training while ensuring that raw data
remains localized at each mine. Despite its advantages, FL in underground
mining faces key challenges: (i) An attacker may compromise a mine's local
model by employing techniques such as sign-flipping attacks or additive noise,
leading to erroneous predictions; (ii) Low-quality (yet potentially valuable)
data, caused by poor lighting conditions or sensor inaccuracies in mines may
degrade the FL training process. In response, this paper proposes MineDetect, a
defense FL framework that detects and isolates the attacked models while
mitigating the impact of mines with low-quality data. MineDetect introduces two
key innovations: (i) Detecting attacked models (maliciously manipulated) by
developing a history-aware mechanism that leverages local and global averages
of gradient updates; (ii) Identifying and eliminating adversarial influences
from unreliable models (generated by clients with poor data quality) on the FL
training process. Comprehensive simulations across diverse datasets demonstrate
that MineDetect outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy,
even in challenging non-IID data scenarios. Its ability to counter adversarial
influences while maintaining lower computational efficiency makes it a vital
advancement for improving safety and operational effectiveness in underground
mining.

Motivation: 解决入侵检测系统（IDS）因网络流量异质性和攻击模式多样性导致的泛化与鲁棒性不足问题。

Method: 提出BERTector框架，包含NSS-Tokenizer（流量感知语义分词）、监督微调（混合数据集）和LoRA（高效训练）。

Result: 实验表明BERTector在检测精度、跨数据集泛化能力和对抗扰动鲁棒性上达到最优。

Conclusion: 为复杂动态网络环境中的现代IDS提供了统一高效解决方案。

Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are facing challenges in generalization and
robustness due to the heterogeneity of network traffic and the diversity of
attack patterns. To address this issue, we propose a new joint-dataset training
paradigm for IDS and propose a scalable BERTector framework based on BERT.
BERTector integrates three key components: NSS-Tokenizer for traffic-aware
semantic tokenization, supervised fine-tuning with a hybrid dataset, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient training. Extensive experiments show
that BERTector achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, strong
cross-dataset generalization capabilities, and excellent robustness to
adversarial perturbations. This work establishes a unified and efficient
solution for modern IDS in complex and dynamic network environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文指出USENIX Security 2025中关于MIRAGE随机化缓存攻击的研究存在建模错误，导致攻击结果不准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证USENIX Security 2025中关于MIRAGE缓存攻击的结论是否正确。

Method: 重新模拟MIRAGE缓存，随机化每次运行的种子，以反映真实操作。

Result: 随机化种子后，攻击失败，表明原研究的泄漏是建模错误的产物。

Conclusion: MIRAGE在实际操作中不存在漏洞，原研究的结论源于错误的建模。

Abstract: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 claims that occupancy-based
attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper,
we examine these claims and find that they arise from fundamental modeling
flaws. Most critically, the authors' simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed
to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE,
causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic
sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing
pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE,
where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead
randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the
correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and
the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact
of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

TL;DR: AlDBaran是一种高性能的认证数据库，通过优化Merkle树更新机制和消除磁盘I/O操作，实现了50 Gbps的网络吞吐量，显著超越现有区块链系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有认证数据库无法满足高吞吐量区块链系统（如百万级TPS）的需求，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: AlDBaran通过消除关键路径中的磁盘I/O、实施预取策略和优化Merkle树更新机制，实现了高效的状态更新。

Result: AlDBaran在相同机器配置下实现了每秒4800万次更新，在消费级便携硬件上也能达到每秒800万次更新。

Conclusion: AlDBaran为高吞吐量区块链系统提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，并支持历史状态证明，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: The fundamental basis for maintaining integrity within contemporary
blockchain systems is provided by authenticated databases. Our analysis
indicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain
fail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing
transactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial
advancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from
the critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update
mechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data
structure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput
of 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically
documented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most
high-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.
  AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a
wide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran
could enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to
offer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.
  When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects,
AlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran
achieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an
identical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an
attractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data
capabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further
enhances performance. On consumer-level portable hardware, it achieves
approximately 8 million updates/s in an in-memory setting and 5 million
updates/s with snapshots at sub-second intervals, illustrating compelling and
cost-effective scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展[DMR25]中的IOPP协议，使其适用于更多类型的代码，同时保持较低的soundness参数和较好的复杂性参数。

Method: 利用Cayley图的良好扩展性质，将IOPP协议推广到基于Cayley图的代码。

Result: 协议保留了较低的soundness参数，复杂性参数略有下降，适用于具有恒定速率和最小距离的代码。

Conclusion: 该推广方法为代码选择提供了更大的灵活性，同时保持了协议的效率和安全性。

Abstract: Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity (IOPP) are at the heart of code-based
SNARKs, a family of zeroknowledge protocols. The first and most famous one is
the FRI protocol [BBHR18a], that efficiently tests proximity to Reed-Solomon
codes. This paper generalizes the flowering IOPP introduced in [DMR25] for some
specific (2, n)-regular Tanner codes to a much broader variety of codes: any
code with symbols indexed on the edges of a Cayley graph. The flowering
protocol of [DMR25] had a soundness parameter much lower than the FRI protocol
[BCI + 23], and complexity parameters that could compete with the FRI
[BBHR18a]. The lower soundness and the absence of restriction on the base field
may lead to other practical speedups, however the codes considered in [DMR25]
have an o(1) minimum distance. The generalization proposed in this paper
preserves the soundness parameter with a slight decrease of the complexity
parameters, while allowing being applied on codes with constant rate and
constant minimum distance thanks to the good expansion properties of some
families of Cayley graphs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数上优于传统技术。

Conclusion: Transformer模型是检测物联网DDoS攻击的有效解决方案，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: DDoS attacks have become a major threat to the security of IoT devices and
can cause severe damage to the network infrastructure. IoT devices suffer from
the inherent problem of resource constraints and are therefore susceptible to
such resource-exhausting attacks. Traditional methods for detecting DDoS
attacks are not efficient enough to cope with the dynamic nature of IoT
networks, as well as the scalability of the attacks, diversity of protocols,
high volume of traffic, and variability in device behavior, and variability of
protocols like MQTT, CoAP, making it hard to implement security across all the
protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., the use of
Transformer models, which have shown remarkable performance in natural language
processing tasks, for detecting DDoS attacks on IoT devices. The proposed model
extracts features from network traffic data and processes them using a
self-attention mechanism. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional machine learning
techniques, which can be validated by comparing both approaches' accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of this study show that the
Transformer models can be an effective solution for detecting DDoS attacks on
IoT devices and have the potential to be deployed in real-world IoT
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PIDSes易受图操纵攻击影响，缺乏鲁棒解决方案，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 结合逻辑感知噪声注入（LNI）生成语义有效的图视图，并通过逻辑保留对比学习框架学习不变表示。

Result: 在多个溯源数据集上的评估显示，MirGuard显著优于现有检测器，对抗攻击的鲁棒性更强且不影响性能。

Conclusion: MirGuard是首个针对PIDSes对抗威胁的解决方案，为现代网络安全挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Learning-based Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have
become essential tools for anomaly detection in host systems due to their
ability to capture rich contextual and structural information, as well as their
potential to detect unknown attacks. However, recent studies have shown that
these systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers
manipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous
approaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it
with a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of
PIDSes.
  To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection
framework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive
representation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural
perturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to
generate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations
preserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data. These views
are then used in a Logic-Preserving Contrastive Learning framework, which
encourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to benign
transformations but sensitive to adversarial inconsistencies. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple provenance datasets demonstrate that MirGuard
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in robustness against
various graph manipulation attacks without sacrificing detection performance
and efficiency. Our work represents the first targeted study to enhance PIDS
against such adversarial threats, providing a robust and effective solution to
modern cybersecurity challenges.

Method: 研究采用多层感知器（MLP）进行动态恶意软件分析，并结合XAI技术评估MLP、CNN、RNN和CNN-LSTM模型的透明度和效果。

Result: 研究旨在揭示深度学习模型的内部工作机制，提升其在网络安全中的预测能力可信度。

Conclusion: 通过XAI技术的应用，研究为深度学习模型在恶意软件检测中的透明度和可信度提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models are one of the security strategies, trained on extensive
datasets, and play a critical role in detecting and responding to these threats
by recognizing complex patterns in malicious code. However, the opaque nature
of these models-often described as "black boxes"-makes their decision-making
processes difficult to understand, even for their creators. This research
addresses these challenges by integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to
enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of malware detection models.
In this research, the use of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for dynamic malware
analysis has been considered, a less explored area, and its efficacy in
detecting Metamorphic Malware, and further the effectiveness and transparency
of MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and CNN-LSTM models in malware classification, evaluating
these models through the lens of Explainable AI (XAI). This comprehensive
approach aims to demystify the internal workings of deep learning models,
promoting a better understanding and trust in their predictive capabilities in
cybersecurity contexts. Such in-depth analysis and implementation haven't been
done to the best of our knowledge.

Motivation: 安全团队因警报疲劳、高误报率和大量非结构化CTI文档而负担过重，手动分析耗时且资源密集。

Method: 采用混合检索机制，结合NLP相似性搜索和标准化查询外部CTI平台，生成上下文相关的安全警报增强信息，并由LLM生成精准的缓解策略。

Result: 实证验证表明，该方法提高了IR的准确性、上下文相关性和效率，减轻了分析师工作量并降低了响应延迟。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的CTI融合在推进自主安全操作和建立智能自适应网络安全框架方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的广泛部署可能引发隐私威胁，恶意代理通过多轮交互提取敏感信息，其动态性使得手动发现漏洞困难。

Method: 采用搜索框架，模拟数据主体、发送者和接收者的交互，利用LLM优化并行搜索和多线程传播迭代改进指令。

Result: 攻击策略从简单请求升级为复杂多轮战术（如冒充和伪造同意），防御从规则约束发展为身份验证状态机。

Conclusion: 发现的攻击和防御策略具有跨场景和模型的实用性，有助于构建隐私感知代理。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Method: 通过BrowseComp-Small基准测试ODR与闭源系统，提出三种改进策略，开发ODR+模型。

Result: 所有系统初始测试准确率为0%，改进后的ODR+达到10%成功率，优于其他系统。

Conclusion: 开源ODR+在改进后表现优于闭源系统，为学术研究提供了可行的开源选择。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

Result: LCPO在多个基准测试中平均减少50%以上的输出长度，同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了在有限数据和训练下高效引导LRMs的潜力，为计算效率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略单一和执行效率低下的问题，限制了其性能和应用。

Method: KompeteAI引入动态解决方案空间探索，包括合并阶段和RAG技术，并结合预测评分模型和加速调试方法。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench基准测试中平均提升3%，并加速管道评估6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法显著提升了AutoML的性能和效率，并在新提出的Kompete-bench中取得最优结果。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Result: 在强化学习、贝叶斯推理和异常检测等应用中展示了熵势框架的潜力。

Conclusion: 熵势框架为AI中的不确定性管理提供了理论基础和多功能方法，结合了热力学、信息论和机器学习的原理。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度思考问题，即在简单问题上耗费过多计算资源，降低效率。现有方法需预设预算或选择推理模式，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出VSRM机制，根据推理轨迹中中间状态的表现分配奖励，结合PPO和Reinforce++算法进行实验验证。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25等数学推理基准测试中，VSRM显著减少了输出长度，同时保持了原有推理性能，有效抑制了无效步骤。

Conclusion: VSRM通过奖励有效步骤和惩罚无效步骤，从根本上缓解了过度思考问题，实现了效率与准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and

TL;DR: HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G通过动态分配KL阈值优化多智能体强化学习，显著提升性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HATRPO为所有智能体分配相同KL阈值，导致训练效率低和局部最优。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W（基于KKT优化全局KL约束）和HATRPO-G（贪心算法优先改进比例高的智能体）。

Result: 实验显示两种方法均显著提升性能（超过22.5%），HATRPO-W学习更稳定。

Conclusion: 动态KL阈值分配在多智能体强化学习中更灵活高效。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，LeanRAG显著优于现有方法，减少了46%的检索冗余。

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过语义网络和高效检索策略提升了RAG的性能和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Conclusion: HiRef通过本体和共现图的结合，显著提升了药物推荐的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0是一个统一系统，通过结构化数学知识系统、模型中心数据空间建模和强化学习训练范式，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据集构建和方法优化，但忽视了知识驱动设计和模型中心数据空间建模，导致MLLMs在复杂数学推理上表现不足。

Method: We-Math 2.0整合了四部分：MathBook知识系统、MathBook-Standard & Pro数据集、MathBook-RL强化学习框架和MathBookEval基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，MathBook-RL在四个广泛使用的基准测试中表现优异，并在MathBookEval上取得强结果，显示出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过综合设计和强化学习，显著提升了MLLMs的数学推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出FIRESPARQL框架，通过微调LLM和结合RAG技术，解决SKG问答中SPARQL查询生成的结构和语义错误，实验表明微调方法性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术知识图谱（SKG）问答任务复杂，LLM生成的SPARQL查询存在结构和语义错误，需改进。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和SPARQL查询修正层，评估多种配置（零样本、单样本、微调等）。

Result: 微调方法表现最佳，测试集上ROUGE-L为0.90，RelaxedEM为0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架有效提升SKG问答中SPARQL查询的准确性和结果质量。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的空间服务（如在线地图）主要依赖用户查询进行位置搜索，但在执行复杂任务（如同时搜索多个相关位置）时体验有限。

Method: 引入SEQ-GPT系统，利用LLM的自然语言能力实现交互式操作（如澄清查询细节和动态调整搜索），并提出了一种定制化的LLM适配流程。

Result: SEQ-GPT通过对话合成和多模型协作，实现了自然语言与结构化空间数据和查询的对齐。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT为扩展空间搜索提供了端到端的解决方案，适用于真实数据和实际应用场景。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI驱动诊断范式DxDirector-7B，旨在从模糊主诉开始主导全流程诊断，显著减少医生工作量并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI在临床诊断中仅作为辅助工具，无法主导全流程诊断，限制了其减轻医生负担和提升效率的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B，一种具备深度思考能力的LLM，能够主导诊断流程并建立责任框架。

Result: 在罕见、复杂和真实案例中，DxDirector-7B显著优于现有医学LLM和通用LLM，减少医生工作量并提高准确性。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从辅助工具转变为诊断主导者，为高效精准诊断提供了新方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

TL;DR: PASS是一个多模态框架，通过概率采样和自适应工具选择解决现有医疗AI系统的黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和计算效率低的问题，显著提升了CXR推理的性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在现实世界应用中存在黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和计算效率低的问题，尤其在医疗领域（如CXR推理）中这些限制更为突出。

Method: PASS通过自适应采样多工具图上的代理工作流，生成带有可解释概率的决策路径，并结合三阶段训练（专家知识预热、对比路径排序和成本感知强化学习）优化性能与成本的平衡。

Result: 实验表明，PASS在多个指标（如准确率、AUC、LLM-J）上显著优于基线模型，同时平衡了计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS为可解释、自适应和多模态医疗代理系统提供了新范式，显著提升了医疗AI的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型与人类偏好对齐对构建可靠AI系统至关重要，但现有方法（如DPO）的动态策略数据效果不一致。

Method: 提出对齐阶段假设，将过程分为偏好注入（需多样性数据）和偏好微调（需高质量数据），并通过实验验证。

Result: 实验表明动态策略数据效果因模型而异（如Llama-3效果提升3倍，Zephyr降低0.4倍），算法能有效识别阶段边界。

Conclusion: 对齐阶段假设具有普适性，为LM对齐提供了理论指导和实用工具。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Method: 提出ComMCS方法，通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡洛估计器，构造无偏估计器，降低方差且不增加计算成本。

Result: 在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中，ComMCS优于回归优化方法2.8分，优于无方差缩减基线2.2分。

Conclusion: ComMCS有效降低估计误差，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Motivation: 现有方法在多属性联合控制时存在干扰和权衡问题，MSRS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MSRS通过分配正交子空间隔离属性影响，结合共享子空间和动态权重函数实现精确控制。

Result: 实验表明MSRS显著减少属性冲突，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多种下游任务。

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性控制提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统在整合外部知识图谱信息时面临复杂语义关系处理的困难，导致推荐结果与用户期望不一致。

Method: STEP采用三阶段课程逐步对齐对话上下文与知识图谱实体，并通过两种自适应前缀提示（对话前缀和推荐前缀）将融合表示注入冻结的语言模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，STEP在两个公开数据集上的推荐精度和对话质量优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过上下文-知识融合和双提示方案，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效扩展到更大网格规模，显著提升策略泛化能力和成功率。

Conclusion: 为大规模广义规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，其带来的错误信息风险增加。现有研究多关注内容真实性，而较少探讨其对人类行为的影响。

Method: 通过MhAIM数据集（包含154,552个在线帖子，其中111,153为AI生成）进行大规模分析，并引入T-Lens系统（基于HR-MCP协议）预测人类反应。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM提供了人类感知能力的工具，揭示了AI、人类认知和信息接收之间的复杂关系，并提出了减少AI错误信息风险的策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否仅通过数据和参数扩展就能获得结构化、可泛化的内部表示。

Method: 引入临床试验自然语言推理基准（四种推理类型），并设计GKMRV探针以区分知识获取和推理失败。评估六种当代LLM的直接和思维链提示表现。

Result: 模型在GKMRV探针上表现优异（准确率0.918），但在主推理任务上表现差（准确率0.25），输出一致性高（0.87），表明其依赖启发式方法。

Conclusion: 当前LLM虽具备相关知识，但缺乏结构化、可组合的内部表示，导致推理不可靠。GKMRV框架为高风险领域LLM可靠性评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在关键领域的广泛应用，可解释性成为提升用户理解和决策能力的关键，但对视觉障碍用户的XAI可访问性研究不足。

Method: 通过文献综述和四部分方法论（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）研究XAI的可访问性。

Result: 初步结果显示，简化解释比详细解释更易理解，多模态呈现有助于提升公平性。

Conclusion: XAI设计需考虑视觉障碍用户，多模态和简化解释是实现包容性的关键。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.
