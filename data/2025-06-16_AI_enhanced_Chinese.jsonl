Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and\nconsequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among\nagents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens\nof cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open\nmulti-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a\nspace of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend\nthis space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,\nthereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis\ngame values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,\nwe represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\\lambda$-returns.\nFurthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the\ncontrolled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.\nDifferent from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an\nexplicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely\ndescribing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To\nestimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\\lambda$)-like\nalgorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to\nas Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the\nconcepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts.

We\nexplore this from a broad conceptual standpoint: rather than studying mental\nmodels of a particular solution, we analyze how users reason about what\nfeatures should be incorporated by two fictitious platforms, Texty and Chatty,\nto prevent third parties from knowing who communicates with whom. Through a\nvignette-based survey with 189 participants, we found that users associate the\nconcept of untraceability with a wide range of privacy enhancing technologies,\nimplying a diverse set of threat models. Overall, the features suggested by\nparticipants show awareness of privacy threats stemming from forms of\nsurveillance and unauthorized access to message contents. Many participants\nalso associated untraceability with the notion of anonymity, but interpreted it\nas senders and receivers concealing their identity from each other rather than\nonly from third parties.

To further\nenhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\npreprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption\noperations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\\times$ on GPU\nfor linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that\nensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the\nresults of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet\nmodel, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s\non CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB.

Through comprehensive\nexperiments on all 300 samples from the SWE-bench benchmark, we found that all\nCoD variants used significantly fewer tokens than Chain of Thought (CoT), with\nBaseline CoD being most efficient at 55.4% of CoT's tokens.

Such\napproaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or\ntoo conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to\nrestructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and\ntesting labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time.

The paper is presented at DRAMSec\n  2025. (see https://dramsec.ethz.ch/)", "summary": "JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for\nDDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations using\nper-row activation counts. While recent PRAC implementations enable holistic\nmitigation of Rowhammer attacks, they impose slowdowns of up to 10% due to the\nincreased DRAM timings for performing a read-modify-write of the counter.\nAlternatively, recent work, Chronus, addresses these slowdowns, but incurs\nenergy overheads due to the additional DRAM activations for counters. In this\npaper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both\nperformance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching\nactivation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and\ncoalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row.

However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the\ncapabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,\nlack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type\nsystems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our\npipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of\nAPIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a\ntheorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no\nfurther testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it\nconfirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is\nrequired.

This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks\nthat bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more\ncomprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these\ntasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded\nsystem programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench\nconsists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware\nplatforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover\nseveral key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic\ninformation, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In\nthe cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance\nwith MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%\npass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%\npass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like\nDeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this\ndomain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge\nduring pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:\nretrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM\nperformance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with\nDeepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.\nAdditionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from\n21.4% to 27.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EmbedAgent\u548cEmbedbench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7EmbedAgent\u6a21\u62df\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Embedbench\uff08\u5305\u542b126\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\uff09\u8bc4\u4f3010\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cDeepSeek-R1\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7535\u8def\u56fe\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4e3a55.6%\uff0c\u65e0\u56fe\u65f6\u4e3a50.0%\uff1b\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMicroPython\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0873.8%\uff09\uff0cESP-IDF\u8f83\u5dee\uff0829.4%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, to achieve this goal, we propose the application\nof the Adaptive Clustering Method (ACM) of Information Systems developed by the\nauthor, which is based on the idea of a seamless system architecture that\nprovides explicit interconnection of project artifacts of different levels of\nabstraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ACM\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ACM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u7f1d\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u9879\u76ee\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e92\u8fde\u3002", "result": "ACM\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\u9879\u76ee\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "ACM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, current benchmarks primarily\nemphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software\nquality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,\nmultilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code\nretrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and\nmaintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725\nqueries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is\naccompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference\nAccuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23\nretrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find\nthat even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or\ninsecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct\npreliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage\nretrievers to recognize code quality.

This practical challenge\nsignificantly limits model performance and application.

Specifically,\nCoda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a\ncompact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be\nidentified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a\ncluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak\nsignals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning\nthat the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing\nPKT solutions.

Yet, the\ninherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated\nsequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant\nchallenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.\nAlthough recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to\nensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose\na novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel\ncode translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of\ntwo models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of\nCo-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate\ndata for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests\nto verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving\nthe Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented\ninput to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL\nsignificantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to\nQwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester\nperformance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while\nachieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents\nregressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the\nsoftware are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is\na complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security\nexperts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of\none of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective\nof vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real\nvulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can\ngenerate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code\nbefore and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on\nthe impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction\nability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases.

Knowing how clients\nare using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug\nreports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of\na bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API\nis used.\n  In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage\nacross 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a\ncombined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how\nwell library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for\nlibrary developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API\nusage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that\nlibrary developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use\ntheir API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a\npopular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by\nthe library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be\nleveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7%\nwith the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the\nAPIs are used in the field.\n  For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be\nused to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce\nvarious metrics useful to library developers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679021\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90C\u5e93\u7684API\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u672a\u6839\u636e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u4f18\u5148\u6d4b\u8bd5API\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u6539\u8fdb\u5e93\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3API\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u5bf9\u5e93\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8621\u4e2aC\u5e93\u53ca\u51763061\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83API\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LibProbe\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb8\u591a\u5e38\u7528API\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982LMDB\u4e2d45%\u7684API\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u4f46\u672a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5e93\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u738714.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e93\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e94\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefAPI\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cLibProbe\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

For the complex multiclass classification of\nquality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision\n(0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall;\ncrowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases\n(0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition\n(0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings\nshow that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing\nor LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while\nthe LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing\nand LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08LPs\uff09\u3001\u4f17\u5305\u5fae\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f17\u5305\u548cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4f17\u5305\u5fae\u4efb\u52a1\u548cLLM\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f17\u5305\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff080.63, 0.72\uff09\uff0cLLM\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6761\u4ef6\uff080.66\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\uff080.68\uff09\u4e5f\u80fd\u5339\u914d\uff1bLPs\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\uff080.38-0.92\uff09\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f17\u5305\u548cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4LPs\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002"}}

Drawing on knowledge from a group of\nmedalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,\nexamining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still\nremain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from\nCodeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the\nlikelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every\nproblem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of\nfailed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find\nthat frontier models still have significant limitations: without external\ntools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems\nand 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find\nthat LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced\nalgorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently\nincorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by\nimplementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.\nLiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster\nlevels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in\ncode-centric LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7LiveCodeBench Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5dee\u8ddd\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LiveCodeBench Pro\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7531\u56fd\u9645\u7ade\u8d5b\u5956\u724c\u5f97\u4e3b\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u96be\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ec553%\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
