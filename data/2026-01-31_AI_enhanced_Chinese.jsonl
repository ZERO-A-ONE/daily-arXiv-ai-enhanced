Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) attempt to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the model training/fine-tuning dataset, posing serious privacy risks. However, most existing MIA techniques against LLMs rely on sequence-level aggregated prediction statistics, which fail to distinguish prediction improvements caused by generalization from those caused by memorization, leading to low attack effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a novel membership inference approach that captures the token-level probabilities for low-confidence (hard) tokens, where membership signals are more pronounced. By comparing token-level probability improvements at hard tokens between a fine-tuned target model and a pre-trained reference model, HT-MIA isolates strong and robust membership signals that are obscured by prior MIA approaches. Extensive experiments on both domain-specific medical datasets and general-purpose benchmarks demonstrate that HT-MIA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art MIA baselines. We further investigate differentially private training as an effective defense mechanism against MIAs in LLMs. Overall, our HT-MIA framework establishes hard-token based analysis as a state-of-the-art foundation for advancing membership inference attacks and defenses for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "HT-MIA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u56f0\u96be\uff09token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5458\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6cdb\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHT-MIA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u56f0\u96be\uff09token\u4e0a\u7684token\u7ea7\u522b\u6982\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6765\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8ehard token\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9btoken\u4e0a\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHT-MIA\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e03\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MIA\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297MIA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "HT-MIA\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u96betoken\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In the context of corporate data management, the concept of sensitivity awareness has been introduced, enabling LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. However, it remains unclear how sensitivity awareness relates to established notions of privacy, such as differential privacy (DP), thereby making it difficult to deploy meaningfully in real-world applications. In this work, we formalize the notion of sensitivity awareness and theoretically establish its connection to DP. Additionally, we develop a supervised fine-tuning recipe to make existing, four-bit quantized LLMs more sensitivity-aware. With a performance boost of up to 21.7%, the finetuned LLMs not only substantially improve over their baseline but also outperform other full-precision open-source and commercial models of similar size in achieving sensitivity awareness, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

However, existing methods suffer from the inefficiency of incremental context construction that requires step-by-step LLM interaction, and often stagnate in suboptimal regions due to surface-level optimization. In this paper, we characterize the Intent-Context Coupling phenomenon, revealing that LLM safety constraints are significantly relaxed when a malicious intent is coupled with a semantically congruent context pattern. Driven by this insight, we propose ICON, an automated multi-turn jailbreak framework that efficiently constructs an authoritative-style context via prior-guided semantic routing. Specifically, ICON first routes the malicious intent to a congruent context pattern (e.g., Scientific Research) and instantiates it into an attack prompt sequence. This sequence progressively builds the authoritative-style context and ultimately elicits prohibited content. In addition, ICON incorporates a Hierarchical Optimization Strategy that combines local prompt refinement with global context switching, preventing the attack from stagnating in ineffective contexts. Experimental results across eight SOTA LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of ICON, achieving a state-of-the-art average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 97.1\\%.

In this paper, we propose the Federated Learning with Loss Trend Detection (FL-LTD), a lightweight and privacy-preserving defense framework that detects and mitigates malicious behavior by monitoring temporal loss dynamics rather than model gradients. The proposed approach identifies anomalous clients by detecting abnormal loss stagnation or abrupt loss fluctuations across communication rounds. To counter adaptive attackers, a short-term memory mechanism is incorporated to sustain mitigation for clients previously flagged as anomalous, while enabling trust recovery for stable participants. We evaluate FL-LTD on a non-IID federated MNIST setup under loss manipulation attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances robustness, achieving a final test accuracy of 0.84, compared to 0.41 for standard FedAvg under attack. FL-LTD incurs negligible computational and communication overhead, maintains stable convergence, and avoids client exclusion or access to sensitive data, highlighting the effectiveness of loss-based monitoring for secure federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFL-LTD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u635f\u5931\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53d1\u9001\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u52a0\u5bc6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u635f\u5931\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b(FL-LTD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u65f6\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u635f\u5931\u505c\u6ede\u6216\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6301\u7eed\u7f13\u89e3\u5148\u524d\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u7a33\u5b9a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975eIID\u8054\u90a6MNIST\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb\uff0cFL-LTD\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u52300.84\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6FedAvg\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4e3a0.41\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "FL-LTD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6392\u9664\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u63a7\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability.

Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher.

Concurrent approaches have limitations: Bienstock et al. (ePrint 2025/1163) achieve arbitrary $T$ but require honest-majority and 37--136 rounds; Celi et al. (ePrint 2026/013) achieve dishonest-majority but are limited to $T \\leq 6$. Our technique addresses the barrier that Lagrange coefficients grow as $\u0398(q)$ for moderate $T$, making individual contributions too large for ML-DSA's rejection sampling.\n  Unlike ECDSA threshold schemes where pairwise masks suffice for correctness, ML-DSA requires solving three additional challenges absent in prior work: (1) rejection sampling on $\\|z\\|_\\infty$ must still pass after masking, (2) the $r_0$-check exposes $c s_2$ enabling key recovery if unprotected, and (3) the resulting Irwin-Hall nonce distribution must preserve EUF-CMA security. We solve all three.\n  We instantiate this technique in three deployment profiles with full security proofs. Profile P1 (TEE-assisted) achieves 3-round signing with a trusted coordinator, with EUF-CMA security under Module-SIS. Profile P2 (fully distributed) eliminates hardware trust via MPC in 8 rounds, achieving UC security against malicious adversaries corrupting up to $n-1$ parties. Profile P3 (2PC-assisted) uses lightweight 2PC for the $r_0$-check in 3--5 rounds, achieving UC security under a 1-of-2 CP honest assumption with the best empirical performance (249ms).\n  Our scheme requires $|S| \\geq T+1$ signers and achieves success rates of 23--32\\%, matching single-signer ML-DSA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u63a9\u7801\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u91cd\u6784\"\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u9608\u503cT\u7684ML-DSA\u9608\u503c\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6807\u51c63.3KB\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u53ef\u7531\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7684FIPS 204\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff1aBienstock\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610fT\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8bda\u5b9e\u591a\u6570\u548c37-136\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\uff1bCeli\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\u591a\u6570\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8eT\u22646\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u6570\u968fq\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2a\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u8fc7\u5927\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7ML-DSA\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u91cd\u6784\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ML-DSA\u9608\u503c\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u63a9\u7801\u540e\u4ecd\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2) r0\u68c0\u67e5\u4f1a\u66b4\u9732c s2\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bc6\u94a5\u6062\u590d\u98ce\u9669\uff1b3) \u4fdd\u6301Irwin-Hall\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684EUF-CMA\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u914d\u7f6e\uff1aP1\uff08TEE\u8f85\u52a9\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff1bP2\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\uff09\u901a\u8fc7MPC\u6d88\u9664\u786c\u4ef6\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1bP3\uff082PC\u8f85\u52a9\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea72PC\u8fdb\u884cr0\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u9608\u503cT\u7684ML-DSA\u9608\u503c\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6807\u51c63.3KB\u7b7e\u540d\u3002\u4e09\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\uff1aP1\u5728Module-SIS\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5177\u6709EUF-CMA\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1bP2\u5728\u6076\u610f\u654c\u624b\u6700\u591a\u8150\u5316n-1\u65b9\u65f6\u5177\u6709UC\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1bP3\u57281-of-2 CP\u8bda\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5177\u6709UC\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a249ms\u3002\u9700\u8981|S|\u2265T+1\u4e2a\u7b7e\u540d\u8005\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u738723-32%\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u7b7e\u540d\u8005ML-DSA\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a9\u7801\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u91cd\u6784\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ML-DSA\u9608\u503c\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u9608\u503cT\u7684\u9608\u503c\u7b7e\u540d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2.

A Critical Analysis of Systematic Literature Reviews on Agile Effort and Cost Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0(SLR)\u91cd\u590d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u654f\u6377\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e00\u5177\u4f53\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3a\u91cd\u590dSLR\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u7406\u7531\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0(SLR)\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5145\u5206\u68c0\u67e5\u5df2\u6709SLR\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4f5c\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u91cd\u590d\u7684SLR\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u6377\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e00\u72ed\u7a84\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u5145\u5206\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5bf918\u7bc7\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684SLR\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u7528\u6570\u636e\u3001\u53d1\u8868\u5e74\u4efd\u3001\u53d1\u8868\u573a\u6240\u4ee5\u53caSLR\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1)\u58f0\u79f0\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u767d\uff1b2)\u6307\u51fa\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b3)\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5148\u524dSLR\u5df2\u8fc7\u65f6\uff1b4)\u5f3a\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u72ed\u7a84\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684SLR\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6307\u5357\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f1a\u8bae\u671f\u520a\u653f\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709SLR\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u65b0SLR\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life.

We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling.

Existing protection methods either modify the model to embed watermarks, which impairs performance, or extract model fingerprints by manipulating the denoising process, rendering them incompatible with black-box APIs. In this paper, we propose TrajPrint, a completely lossless and training-free framework that verifies model copyright by extracting unique manifold fingerprints formed during deterministic generation. Specifically, we first utilize a watermarked image as an anchor and exactly trace the path back to its trajectory origin, effectively locking the model fingerprint mapped by this path. Subsequently, we implement a joint optimization strategy that employs dual-end anchoring to synthesize a specific fingerprint noise, which strictly adheres to the target manifold for robust watermark recovery. As input, it enables the protected target model to recover the watermarked image, while failing on non-target models.

The accompanying dataset supporting this systematic literature review is publicly available on Zenodo", "summary": "Context: Blockchain and AI are increasingly explored to enhance trustworthiness in software engineering (SE), particularly in supporting software evolution tasks. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using a predefined protocol with clear eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and minimized bias, synthesizing research on blockchain-enabled trust in AI-driven SE tools and processes. Results: Most studies focus on integrating AI in SE, with only 31% explicitly addressing trustworthiness. Our review highlights six recent studies exploring blockchain-based approaches to reinforce reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted SE tasks. Conclusion: Blockchain enhances trust by ensuring data immutability, model transparency, and lifecycle accountability, including federated learning with blockchain consensus and private data verification. However, inconsistent definitions of trust and limited real-world testing remain major challenges. Future work must develop measurable, reproducible trust frameworks to enable reliable, secure, and compliant AI-driven SE ecosystems, including applications involving large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0eAI\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u670931%\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7be1\u6539\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u4fe1\u4efb\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548cAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f14\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u89e3\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u652f\u6301AI\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8AI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u53ea\u670931%\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7efc\u8ff0\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u516d\u9879\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7be1\u6539\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ecd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Motivated by the research software supply chain (RSSC) and its security risks, we introduce an RSSC-oriented taxonomy that makes scope and operational boundaries explicit for empirical research software security studies.\n  We conduct a targeted scoping review of recent repository mining and dataset construction studies, extracting each work's definition, inclusion criteria, unit of analysis, and identification heuristics.

Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.

Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. They also suffer from inconsistent data engineering practices, limited software engineering context, and widespread contamination issues. To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop. We identified three core barriers to reliable evaluation: the absence of software-engineering-rich datasets, overreliance on ML-centric metrics, and the lack of standardized, reproducible data pipelines. Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation.

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

Of particular practical interest are checking confidentiality and integrity of secrets, by checking that there is no information flow between the secrets and observable outputs. A standard method for checking information flow is to translate the corresponding non-interference hyperproperty into a safety property on a self-composition of the design, which has two copies of the design composed together. Although prior efforts have aimed to reduce the size of the self-composed design, there are no state-of-the-art model checkers that exploit their special structure for hardware security verification. In this paper, we propose SecIC3, a hardware model checking algorithm based on IC3 that is customized to exploit this self-composition structure. SecIC3 utilizes this structure in two complementary techniques: symmetric state exploration and adding equivalence predicates. We implement SecIC3 on top of two open-source IC3 implementations and evaluate it on a non-interference checking benchmark consisting of 10 designs.

However, as classifiers, LLM routers are vulnerable to novel adversarial attacks in the form of LLM rerouting, where adversaries prepend specially crafted triggers to user queries to manipulate routing decisions. Such attacks can lead to increased computational cost, degraded response quality, and even bypass safety guardrails, yet their security implications remain largely underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by systematizing LLM rerouting threats based on the adversary's objectives (i.e., cost escalation, quality hijacking, and safety bypass) and knowledge. Based on the threat taxonomy, we conduct a measurement study of real-world LLM routing systems against existing LLM rerouting attacks. The results reveal that existing routing systems are vulnerable to rerouting attacks, especially in the cost escalation scenario. We then characterize existing rerouting attacks using interpretability techniques, revealing that they exploit router decision boundaries through confounder gadgets that prepend queries to force misrouting. To mitigate these risks, we introduce RerouteGuard, a flexible and scalable guardrail framework for LLM rerouting. RerouteGuard filters adversarial rerouting prompts via dynamic embedding-based detection and adaptive thresholding. Extensive evaluations in three attack settings and four benchmarks demonstrate that RerouteGuard achieves over 99% detection accuracy against state-of-the-art rerouting attacks, while maintaining negligible impact on legitimate queries. The experimental results indicate that RerouteGuard offers a principled and practical solution for safeguarding multi-model AI systems against adversarial rerouting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RerouteGuard\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u591a\u6a21\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684LLM\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08LLM\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u524d\u6dfb\u52a0\u7279\u6b8a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u751a\u81f3\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u6210\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u52ab\u6301\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff09\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316LLM\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u5a01\u80c1\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684LLM\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51faRerouteGuard\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6210\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff1bRerouteGuard\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc799%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5408\u6cd5\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "RerouteGuard\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u591a\u6a21\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TypeScript\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u6545\u969c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6545\u969c\u4e3b\u8981\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u6392\u8fb9\u754c\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u3002", "motivation": "TypeScript\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3Web\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9eTypeScript\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684bug\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u679016\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u6e90\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684633\u4e2abug\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec4\u6210\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6545\u969c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5de5\u5177\u914d\u7f6e\u6545\u969c\u3001API\u8bef\u7528\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u6216\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0e\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6545\u969c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u6392\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u4e0eJavaScript\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793a\uff0cTypeScript\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTypeScript\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u4f20\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5c42\u9762\u3002"}}

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline.

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.\n  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.\n  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%.

However, its robustness against realistic adversarial threats remains largely unexplored. We introduce ICL-Evader, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that operates under a highly practical zero-query threat model, requiring no access to model parameters, gradients, or query-based feedback during attack generation. We design three novel attacks, Fake Claim, Template, and Needle-in-a-Haystack, that exploit inherent limitations of LLMs in processing in-context prompts. Evaluated across sentiment analysis, toxicity, and illicit promotion tasks, our attacks significantly degrade classifier performance (e.g., achieving up to 95.3% attack success rate), drastically outperforming traditional NLP attacks which prove ineffective under the same constraints. To counter these vulnerabilities, we systematically investigate defense strategies and identify a joint defense recipe that effectively mitigates all attacks with minimal utility loss (<5% accuracy degradation). Finally, we translate our defensive insights into an automated tool that proactively fortifies standard ICL prompts against adversarial evasion. This work provides a comprehensive security assessment of ICL, revealing critical vulnerabilities and offering practical solutions for building more robust systems.

In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result.

This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks.

This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u52a0\u5165\u53d8\u4f53\u65e0\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u8bc4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BLEUpara\u6269\u5c55\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u5355\u4e00\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u53c2\u8003\u8bd1\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u8bed\u548c\u53e3\u8bed\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u540c\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u6837\u6709\u6548\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8en-gram\u7684BLEU\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u66ff\u4ee3\u53c2\u8003\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u59ff\u6001\u7684T5\u6a21\u578b\u5728YouTubeASL\u548cHow2Sign\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51faBLEUpara\u6269\u5c55\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u52a0\u5165\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u5584\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5bb3\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\u5219\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9eBLEUpara\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u3002BLEUpara\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports.

Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (Springer)", "summary": "Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8614B\u53c2\u6570SLM\u5728\u6709\u9650token\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7ecf\u5e38\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u6346\u7ed1\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ef4\u62a4\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u4f7f\u7528CCS\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u63d0\u4ea4\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u5305\u542b\u548c\u5934\u90e8\u4fdd\u7559\u622a\u65ad\u5728\u5b9e\u7528token\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u768414B\u53c2\u6570SLM\u5728\u5355\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5305\u542b\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u53ef\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u8fbe44%\uff08\u4ee5\u6c49\u660e\u635f\u5931\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5305\u542b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Deep learning-based approaches are increasingly popular for their advantages: automatically learning complex patterns and extracting semantic features from HTTP requests to achieve superior detection performance. However, existing methods are less effective in embedding irregular HTTP requests, even failing to model unordered parameters and achieve attack traceability. In this paper, we propose an effective web attack detection model, named WADBERT. It achieves high detection accuracy while enabling the precise identification of malicious parameters. To this end, we first employ Hybrid Granularity Embedding (HGE) to generate fine-grained embeddings for URL and payload parameters. Then, URLBERT and SecBERT are respectively utilized to extract their semantic features. Further, parameter-level features (extracted by SecBERT) are fused through a multi-head attention mechanism, resulting in a comprehensive payload feature. Finally, by feeding the concatenated URL and payload features into a linear classifier, a final detection result is obtained. The experimental results on CSIC2010 and SR-BH2020 datasets validate the efficacy of WADBERT, which respectively achieves F1-scores of 99.63% and 99.50%, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "WADBERT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Web\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u548cBERT\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6076\u610f\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219HTTP\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u65e0\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u6eaf\u6e90\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6076\u610f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWADBERT\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3aURL\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2) \u5206\u522b\u7528URLBERT\u548cSecBERT\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4) \u5c06\u62fc\u63a5\u7684URL\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u5f81\u8f93\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CSIC2010\u548cSR-BH2020\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523099.63%\u548c99.50%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WADBERT\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684Web\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6076\u610f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219HTTP\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6eaf\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76147\u540d\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9891\u7e41\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u826f\u6027\u91c7\u7eb3\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u70ed\u8877\u8005\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u3001\u8c28\u614e\u8005\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7eb3\u9075\u5faa\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\u662f\u91c7\u7eb3\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7eb3\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5165\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3AI\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9AI\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76147\u540d\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u3001\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91c7\u7eb3\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7eb3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9891\u7e41\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u826f\u6027\u91c7\u7eb3\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u70ed\u8877\u8005\u63a8\u52a8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u968f\u540e\u8ddf\u8fdb\uff0c\u8c28\u614e\u8005\u5904\u4e8e\u505c\u6ede\u72b6\u6001\u3002AI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7eb3\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\u662f\u663e\u8457\u91c7\u7eb3\u969c\u788d\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7eb3\u9075\u5faa\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u826f\u6027\u91c7\u7eb3\u5faa\u73af\u662f\u4e2a\u4f53\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002\u7ec4\u7ec7\u653f\u7b56\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7eb3\u6ede\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\u5bf9\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks.

While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\\% and 69.5\\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\\% and 140.1\\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3MLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08CDL\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff08PGPS\uff09\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03MLLM\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u57fa\u7840LLM\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3MLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u58f0\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\uff08CDL\uff09\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684LLM\u57fa\u4e8eCDL\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u91c7\u7528CoT\u589e\u5f3a\u7684SFT\u548cGRPO\u8bad\u7ec3MLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86CDL\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b54\u6848\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\u3001Unigeo\u548cMathVista\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4ec5\u75285.5k\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90MLLM\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684PGPS\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u9002\u5f53\u5730\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002"}}

Yet existing GKA protocols lack adaptability to constrained CPS buses. This paper targets authenticated, fully distributed GKA suitable for bus topologies under constraints of industrial and cyber-physical systems, including broadcast-only links, half-duplex operation, resource limits, dynamic membership (including unannounced leaves), a long device lifetime, and a strong Dolev-Yao adversary capable of partitioning the bus.

Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.\n  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry.

We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.\n  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB.

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods.

Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention.

Detecting RPC Bugs in Ethereum Blockchain Client under Context", "comment": "The paper is accepted by ICSE 2026", "summary": "Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.\n  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates. Three of our bug reports have been offered a vulnerability bounty by the Ethereum Foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EthCRAFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefRPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548cRPC\u8c03\u7528\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefRPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684RPC\u63a5\u53e3\u5b58\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u54cd\u5e94\u751a\u81f3\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210RPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u62a5\u544a\u7684RPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u624d\u80fd\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u9002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u3002", "method": "EthCRAFT\u9996\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u4ea4\u6613\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684RPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u7528\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5411\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53d1\u9001RPC\u8c03\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u75285\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u53c9\u53c2\u8003\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bRPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cEthCRAFT\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefRPC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cEthCRAFT\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e866\u4e2a\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u7ed9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u5df2\u88ab\u5199\u5165\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62a5\u544a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8d4f\u91d1\u3002", "conclusion": "EthCRAFT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefRPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u4e8eRPC\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality.", "AI": {"tldr": "AtPatch\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u70ed\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5f02\u5e38\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u7f13\u89e3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u6216\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f16\u8f91\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u626d\u66f2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "AtPatch\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u70ed\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u3002\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u53d6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u5217\u5e76\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u826f\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u5176\u4ed6\u5217\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u540e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8fd4\u56de\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAtPatch\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AtPatch\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u5373\u65f6\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DoVerifier\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528do-calculus\u548c\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8868\u9762\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDoVerifier\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528do-calculus\u548c\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56e0\u679cQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cDoVerifier\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u548c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DoVerifier\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u8868\u9762\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5e26\u6709Esope\u4e13\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u7684FORTRAN 77\u4ee3\u7801\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230Fortran 2008\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "FORTRAN 77\u7b49\u9057\u7559\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e13\u6709\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5982Esope\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u9057\u7559\u8bed\u8a00\u9650\u5236\u3001\u9886\u57df\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5411\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u5982Fortran 2008\uff09\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u6362\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u51fa\u6613\u4e8e\u9605\u8bfb\u7684Fortran 2008\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u6301Esope\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06Esope\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aFortran 2008\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e26\u6709\u4e13\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u7684FORTRAN 77\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9057\u7559FORTRAN 77\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3001\u9650\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86BEF4LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684BPMN\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210BPMN\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BEF4LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u8bed\u6cd5\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u4f46\u5f97\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86LLM\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884cBPMN\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u64ad\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d9\u4e8b\u3001\u795e\u8bdd\u3001\u4eea\u5f0f\u3001\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7b49\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d41\u4f20\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6536\u96c6\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u5982\u7f3a\u9677\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u300110\u500d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f20\u8bf4\u3001\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf912\u540d\u745e\u5178\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d9\u4e8b\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1a\u5728\u804c\u4e1a\u6c11\u95f4\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5851\u9020\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u5bf9\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7\u548c\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6311\u6218\u65e0\u76ca\u7684\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\u3002"}}

Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation.

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term \"HYDRA\" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHYDRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e3b\u6743\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf(CPS)\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e3b\u6743\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236(HYDRA\u6846\u67b6)\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "HYDRA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u673a\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u79bb\u5076\u7136\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aCPS\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u72b6\u6001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u5851\u6027-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e3b\u6743\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952eCPS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Drive-KD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406-\u89c4\u5212\u4e09\u4e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cfGPU\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u96be\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDrive-KD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u4e09\u4e2a\u80fd\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5355\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u7f13\u89e3\u8de8\u80fd\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684InternVL3-1B\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u540c\u7cfb\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec378B\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea642\u500dGPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611.4\u500d\uff0c\u5728DriveBench\u4e0a\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7GPT-5.1", "conclusion": "Drive-KD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

Vukovic", "Jia Wu"], "title": "Modeling Endogenous Logic: Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation", "comment": "Accepted to The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies.

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u5907\u4ef6\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u5907\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u5982MAE\u3001RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u603b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u9488\u5bf9\u5907\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b(2) \u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b(3) \u6d88\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u8425KPI\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5e93\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u8425\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u7eff\u8272AI\u8303\u5f0f\u5c06\u80fd\u8017\u89c6\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u6548\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u8017\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5143\u6570\u3001\u6b7b\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u75285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u9886\u57df\u548c5\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c632\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u8017\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7eff\u8272AI\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures.

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary.

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce.

In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy.

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion.

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords.

Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations.

We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories.

Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Order-r Interaction\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faALiCoT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728token\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916token\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u9690\u5f0fCoT\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86token\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165Order-r Interaction\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6027\uff1b2. \u521b\u5efaNatBool-DAG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u6377\u5f84\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51faALiCoT\uff08Aligned Implicit CoT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728token\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u969c\u788d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aALiCoT\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8654.4\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86CoT\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faALiCoT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively.

In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \\underline{A}c\\underline{t}ive Latent \\underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bfb\u627e\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6587\u6863\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u4fdd\u9669\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6545\u969c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6587\u6863\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6587\u6863\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u73b0\u5b9e\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7279\u5b9a\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6240\u6709\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5ef6\u8fdf\u91cd\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation.

To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction.

Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation.

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards.

Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u89e3\u91ca\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u59cb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528SHAP\u548cUMAP\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u8de8\u5927\u9646\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

We identify that this \\textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity.

This approach facilitates \\textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \\textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \\textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \\textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\\% to 39.0\\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\\% to 10.02\\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u60e9\u7f5a\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e76\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u52a0\u6743\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5236\u7b80\u6d01\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5173\u952e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6SCMA\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u5206\u5272\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u5757\uff1b\u8bc4\u5206\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u5176\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cSCMA\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1111.1%\u523039.0%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad84.33%\u523010.02%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MARL\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRL\u8303\u5f0f\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SCMA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolWeaver\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u53cc\u91cd\u8bed\u4e49\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5de5\u5177\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u65b0\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5371\u673a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToolWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bcd\u6c47\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u5171\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f16\u7ec7\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd147,000\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cToolWeaver\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolWeaver\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u3002"}}

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas.

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions.

We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAR-bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e7b\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6d88\u6b67\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7406\u60f3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9075\u5faa\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CAR-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542bLLM\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u548c58\u4e2a\u4e92\u8054\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3001\u5145\u7535\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u7684\u6781\u9650\u8ba4\u77e5\uff09\u548c\u6d88\u6b67\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8981\u6c42\u901a\u8fc7\u6f84\u6e05\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u5076\u7136\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406LLM\u5728\u6d88\u6b67\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4e5f\u4f4e\u4e8e50%\uff08\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u65e9\u884c\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u7b56\u7565\u6216\u7f16\u9020\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9075\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data.

However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgent-RRM\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff1a1)\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2)\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b3)\u603b\u4f53\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff1aReagent-C\uff08\u6587\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u3001Reagent-R\uff08\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u5bfc\uff09\u548cReagent-U\uff08\u7edf\u4e00\u53cd\u9988\u96c6\u6210\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cReagent-U\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u98de\u8dc3\uff0c\u5728GAIA\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523043.7%\uff0c\u5728WebWalkerQA\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523046.2%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent-RRM\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5747\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
