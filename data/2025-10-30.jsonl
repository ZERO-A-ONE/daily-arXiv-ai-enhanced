While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to\nsequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can\ncollectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally.

Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on\nconversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on\nmental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from\nindividual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making\nprocess, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method\nfor deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM\nconsortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and\nresponsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a\nreasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for\nmental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating\nthree fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in\ncollaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,\nUSA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application\nof a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical\nmental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth\nsystems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses."}

Existing approaches\ntypically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force\nVLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We\npresent Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement\nlearning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of\nactively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel\nfetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the\nclassic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense\nprocess supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level\nreward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the\nempirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from\nlong documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that\napplies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual\nrepresentations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed\nfrom three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nfive long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive\ndocument reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across\nlong, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and\nefficient long-document understanding."}

To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic\nand adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone\nof TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex\ncounseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management\nand a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session\nLoop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response\nstrategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.\nCrucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term\nadaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each\nsession and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our\napproach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical\ncases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,\nespecially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and\nTherapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in\nemulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior.
