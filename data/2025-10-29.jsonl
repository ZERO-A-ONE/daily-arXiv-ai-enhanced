This inconsistency may not only lead to\ndifferences in protocol functions but also cause serious security\nvulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack\nfunctions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly\nimportant to detect and fix these inconsistencies. With the rise of large\nlanguage models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol\nspecifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol\nstack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other\nrelated content.

While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture\nthe characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring\nthe integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data\nresources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them\nunsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).\nMeanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where\nanswers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require\nmulti-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs\nprohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck\nfor training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.\n  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating\nhigh-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured\nknowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence\nclusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and\ndiversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to\ncompose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their\ncombination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality\nwith a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus\nfiltering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.\nThe result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet\nverifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging\nevaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the\ndifficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks."}

In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance.

Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an\neconomic side, as development time efforts are required to build the\ninteroperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field\nof large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of\nLLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,\nwithout human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated\nfour versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We\nperformed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two\ndifferent strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the\nconsistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b\nwas the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=\n0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset\nversions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all\nmodels using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN\nqwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some\nLLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in\ndifferent domains is recommended, and further research on reliability\nstrategies should be conducted."}

Our approach co-locates\nintegrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU\naccelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads\ntypically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally\noperate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate\nperformance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing\ncryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g.,\nIntel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the\npotential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based\nverification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages\nthe same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives\nthat power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model\nexecution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a\ncommon integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across\ndifferent GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future\ncapabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution\nenvironments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation\nthat enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU\ninfrastructures."}

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a\ncompelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data,\nallowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs.\nHowever, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines\nremains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity,\nand model compatibility issues.\n  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of\ncloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving\nML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules\nwith Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel\nencrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore,\noptimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus\nadjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource\nconsumption while preserving cryptographic integrity.
