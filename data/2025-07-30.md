### [1] [Generating Highly Structured Test Inputs Leveraging Constraint-Guided Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21271)
*Zhaorui Yang,Yuxin Qiu,Haichao Zhu,Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于图的测试输入生成框架GRAphRef，旨在统一结构化数据的测试输入生成，提高输入有效性和语义保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模糊测试工具和输入生成器通常针对特定输入类型手工设计，生成无效输入导致效率低下和泛化性差。

Method: 开发GRAphRef框架，将结构化输入映射为图，应用邻居相似性引导的变异，并通过约束修复阶段修复无效输入。

Result: 在八个真实网格处理AI系统上评估GRAphRef，比较其与AFL、MeshAttack等工具的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAphRef通过图表示和约束修复，显著提升了输入有效性和语义保留能力。

Abstract: [Context] Modern AI applications increasingly process highly structured data,
such as 3D meshes and point clouds, where test input generation must preserve
both structural and semantic validity. However, existing fuzzing tools and
input generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often
generate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to
inefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates
whether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based
representation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing
structural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in
enhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.
[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation
framework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps
structured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and
uses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a
confirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,
comparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.
Evaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via
prediction consistency), and performance overhead. Experimental data is derived
from ShapeNetCore mesh seeds and model outputs from systems like MeshCNN and
HodgeNet. Statistical analysis and component latency breakdowns will be used to
assess each hypothesis.

*Courtney Miller,Rudrajit Choudhuri,Mara Ulloa,Sankeerti Haniyur,Robert DeLine,Margaret-Anne Storey,Emerson Murphy-Hill,Christian Bird,Jenna L. Butler*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，开发者对生成式AI工具的采用不均衡，主要源于对工具的认知差异、使用方式及应对挑战的态度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开发者对生成式AI工具采用不均衡的原因及其对生产力和管理期望的影响。

Method: 通过对27个团队的54名开发者进行配对访谈（每团队一名频繁使用者和一名不频繁使用者）。

Result: 开发者对工具的认知（协作伙伴vs.功能）、使用方式（实验性vs.保守）和应对挑战的态度（适应性坚持vs.快速放弃）是主要差异来源。

Conclusion: 组织对快速生产力提升的期望与学习支持不足形成“生产力压力悖论”，反而阻碍了生产力提升。

Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of generative AI tools in software
engineering, developer adoption remains uneven. This unevenness is problematic
because it hampers productivity efforts, frustrates management's expectations,
and creates uncertainty around the future roles of developers. Through paired
interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams -- one frequent and one
infrequent user per team -- we demonstrate that differences in usage result
primarily from how developers perceive the tool (as a collaborator vs.
feature), their engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and how
they respond when encountering challenges (with adaptive persistence vs. quick
abandonment). Our findings imply that widespread organizational expectations
for rapid productivity gains without sufficient investment in learning support
creates a "Productivity Pressure Paradox," undermining the very productivity
benefits that motivate adoption.

### [3] [Black-Box Bug-Amplification for Multithreaded Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21318)
*Yeshayahu Weiss,Gal Amram,Achiya Elyasaf,Eitan Farchi,Oded Margalit,Gera Weiss*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出一种通过预测模型放大并发系统中罕见Bug出现概率的方法，显著优于随机采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并发系统中的Bug难以复现，因其仅在特定条件下出现。

Method: 将系统视为黑盒，通过重复试验训练预测模型，估计输入配置触发Bug的概率。

Result: 在17种并发Bug上评估，模型引导的搜索显著提高Bug出现率，通常比随机采样高一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法为罕见Bug的放大提供了一种非侵入性、有效的测试框架。

Abstract: Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce
because they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter
failures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low
probability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of
such elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use
repeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the
probability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this
approach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse
categories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a
brute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of
regression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly
all scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random
sampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of
bug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical
evaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating
the effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive
testing framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults
without altering the internal system architecture.

### [4] [Does Editing Improve Answer Quality on Stack Overflow? A Data-Driven Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21329)
*Saikat Mondal,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了Stack Overflow上Python相关答案的编辑效果，发现编辑对质量维度的影响不一致，既有积极也有消极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术问答平台的高质量答案对软件开发至关重要，但编辑对答案质量的影响尚未系统评估。

Method: 分析了94,994条有至少一次被接受编辑的Python相关答案，评估编辑对6个质量维度的影响。

Result: 53.3%的编辑提高了语义相关性，但38.1%降低了相关性；9%的代码从不可执行变为可执行，14.7%的代码变为不可解析；32.3%的编辑增加了代码复杂性；20.5%的编辑引入了安全问题；51.0%的编辑优化了性能，但总体执行时间增加；49.7%的编辑降低了可读性。

Conclusion: 编辑效果不一致，可能影响软件的可维护性、安全性和效率，需引起用户和平台注意。

Abstract: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) are
crucial as they directly influence software development practices. Poor-quality
answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and
thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To
improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise
answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have
examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior
research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key
quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++
vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we
analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to
determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)
code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)
readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.
While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them
less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working
code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity
(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,
20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize
performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,
as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the
inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact
software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and
moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems.

### [5] [MAAD: Automate Software Architecture Design through Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21382)
*Ruiyin Li,Yiran Zhang,Xiyu Zhou,Peng Liang,Weisong Sun,Jifeng Xuan,Zhi Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD是一个基于多智能体系统的自动化软件架构设计框架，通过四个专业代理协作生成架构蓝图和评估报告，优于现有基线，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件架构设计依赖人工，耗时且设计选择有限，尤其是在敏捷开发中。LLM在软件工程任务中表现优异，但在架构设计中的应用仍需探索。

Method: MAAD框架利用四个专业代理（分析师、建模师、设计师和评估师）协作完成需求解析和架构设计，并生成基于质量属性的评估报告。

Result: MAAD在案例研究和对比实验中优于MetaGPT，能生成更全面的架构组件和结构化评估报告。工业界反馈也验证了其实用性。GPT-4o在三种LLM中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MAAD为自动化架构设计提供了有效解决方案，强调了LLM选择的重要性，并展示了多智能体协作的潜力。

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

### [6] [LLM4VV: Evaluating Cutting-Edge LLMs for Generation and Evaluation of Directive-Based Parallel Programming Model Compiler Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447)
*Zachariah Sollenberger,Rahul Patel,Saieda Ali Zada,Sunita Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双LLM系统（生成型和判别型），用于生成大量编译器测试并验证其正确性，解决了LLM输出不可信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在软件开发中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其生成代码正确性的全面验证方法，且LLM的幻觉问题和不透明逻辑导致结果不可信。

Method: 采用双LLM系统（生成型和判别型），实验了不同参数规模的LLM，并通过十项指标评估其生成编译器测试的能力。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在生成高质量编译器测试和自动验证方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 双LLM系统能有效提升LLM在编译器测试生成中的实用性和可信度。

Abstract: The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development
has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently
have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness
of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have
been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet.
Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems
without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to
explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their
results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply
LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a
discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation
of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs
possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten
carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through
our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to
generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.

### [7] [HLSDebugger: Identification and Correction of Logic Bugs in HLS Code with LLM Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21485)
*Jing Wang,Shang Liu,Yao Lu,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HLSDebugger利用LLMs解决HLS逻辑调试的三大挑战，通过生成大规模数据集和采用编码器-解码器结构，显著提升调试效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HLS调试对新手和缺乏硬件知识的软件工程师来说困难且耗时，LLMs的应用潜力巨大但面临数据稀缺、逻辑复杂和多任务需求等挑战。

Method: 提出HLSDebugger，生成30万样本的数据集，采用编码器-解码器结构，同时进行错误定位、类型预测和修正。

Result: HLSDebugger在错误识别和修正上显著优于GPT-4，修正效率提升3倍以上。

Conclusion: HLSDebugger为HLS代码自动化调试提供了重要进展。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

### [8] [Ethical Classification of Non-Coding Contributions in Open-Source Projects via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21583)
*Sergio Cobos,Javier Luis Cánovas Izquierdo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，用于分类开源软件（OSS）项目中非代码贡献的伦理质量，旨在通过定义伦理指标和分类方法，促进更尊重和包容的社区环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件开发面临伦理挑战，影响项目可持续性。现有行为准则（如Contributor Covenant）的监控和执行存在局限性，需要更有效的方法来评估非代码贡献的伦理质量。

Method: 基于Contributor Covenant定义伦理指标，利用大型语言模型（LLM）和提示工程（prompt engineering）开发分类方法，评估非代码贡献的伦理行为。

Result: 提出了一种能够分类非代码贡献伦理质量的方法，为开源社区提供了一种监控和评估伦理行为的工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为开源项目提供了一种可行的伦理行为评估方案，有助于促进更健康、包容的社区环境。

Abstract: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) is not only a technical
challenge, but also a social one due to the diverse mixture of contributors. To
this aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure
needed to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the
community's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as
issues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing
contributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process
faces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.
To foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly
deploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and
inclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the
main model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct
is a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this
paper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding
contributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a
promising technology for text classification tasks. We defined a set of ethical
metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and developed a classification
approach to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, using
prompt engineering to guide the model's output.

### [9] [Predicting Maintenance Cessation of Open Source Software Repositories with An Integrated Feature Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21678)
*Yiming Xu,Runzhi He,Hengzhi Ye,Minghui Zhou,Huaimin Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于‘维护终止’概念的预测方法，结合多视角特征框架，显著提升了开源软件维护风险的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件维护风险对软件供应链的质量、安全和韧性构成威胁，现有方法存在定义模糊、可解释性差和数据不足的问题。

Method: 引入‘维护终止’概念，构建大规模数据集（115,466个GitHub仓库），提出多视角特征框架（用户、维护者和项目演化特征），并应用AFT生存分析和SHAP分析。

Result: AFT生存分析的C-index达0.846，显著优于仅依赖表面特征的模型。特征消融和SHAP分析验证了方法的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模开源生态系统的维护风险预测提供了可扩展、可解释的基础，并在openEuler生态系统中验证了实际应用价值。

Abstract: The maintenance risks of open source software (OSS) projects pose significant
threats to the quality, security, and resilience of modern software supply
chains. While prior research has proposed diverse approaches for predicting OSS
maintenance risk -- leveraging signals ranging from surface features (e.g.,
stars, commits) to social network analyses and behavioral patterns -- existing
methods often suffer from ambiguous operational definitions, limited
interpretability, and datasets of insufficient scale or generalizability. In
this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit
archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation.
Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of
115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events
-- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We
propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting
maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features,
maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival
analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming
models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis
further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying a GBSA classifier
in the openEuler ecosystem for proactive package risk screening. Our work
establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk
prediction, enabling reproducible risk management across large-scale open
source ecosystems.

*Basak Demirok,Mucahid Kutlu,Selin Mergen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了MultiAIGCD数据集，用于检测AI生成的代码，涵盖Python、Java和Go语言，并评估了三种检测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在代码生成中的广泛应用，维护学术诚信和招聘公平性需要开发可靠的AI生成代码检测系统。

Method: 从CodeNet数据集生成AI代码样本，涵盖三种语言和六种LLM，构建包含121,271个AI生成和32,148个人工编写代码的数据集。

Result: 论文评估了三种检测模型在跨模型和跨语言场景下的性能。

Conclusion: MultiAIGCD数据集和代码公开，支持相关研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

### [11] [Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928)
*Christian Meske,Tobias Hermanns,Esther von der Weiden,Kai-Uwe Loser,Thorsten Berger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI生成的代码（vibe coding）如何改变软件开发范式，强调人类与生成式AI通过自然语言对话协作，重新分配认知工作，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成代码的普及，快速采用与有限概念理解之间的脱节促使研究这一新兴范式。

Method: 通过意图视角和历史分析，定义vibe coding为人类与生成式AI通过自然语言对话协作的软件开发范式。

Result: 研究发现vibe coding重新分配认知工作，将专业知识从传统领域转向协作编排，同时揭示了机遇与风险。

Conclusion: 提出了以人类、技术和组织为中心的未来研究议程，以指导这一范式的进一步探索。

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

### [12] [DeepGo: Predictive Directed Greybox Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21952)
*Peihong Lin,Pengfei Wang,Xu Zhou,Wei Xie,Gen Zhang,Kai Lu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DeepGo是一种预测性定向灰盒模糊器，结合历史和预测信息，通过最优路径引导模糊测试到达目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGF技术依赖启发式算法优化适应度指标，缺乏对未执行路径的预见性，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出路径转换模型和虚拟集成环境（VEE），结合深度神经网络和强化学习（RLF）生成最优路径转换序列。

Result: DeepGo能高效到达目标站点，优化模糊测试路径。

Conclusion: DeepGo通过预测和优化路径转换序列，显著提升DGF效率。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

*Zengyang Li,Yimeng Li,Binbin Huang,Peng Liang,Ran Mo,Hui Liu,Yutao Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练代码语言模型（CodeLMs）在跨语言错误（CLB）检测中的潜力，开发了工具CLCFinder并构建了数据集。实验表明，微调后的CodeLMs性能显著提升，但小型模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言编程（多语言项目）日益普遍，但会引入难以检测的跨语言错误（CLBs），需探索有效检测方法。

Method: 开发了CLCFinder工具，构建了包含三种语言组合和九种交互类型的CLB数据集，并对13种CodeLMs进行微调和评估。

Result: 微调后CodeLMs性能显著提升，UniXcoder-base表现最佳（F1=0.7407）。小型模型优于大型模型，单语言错误数据集微调的模型表现不佳。

Conclusion: CodeLMs在CLB检测中潜力显著，但需针对性微调和数据集优化。代码注释的影响因模型而异。

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于加密医学图像的隐私保护诊断框架，结合AES-CBC加密和JPEG2000压缩，确保数据隐私同时保持AI推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗诊断中的快速应用引发了对患者隐私的担忧，尤其是敏感图像数据的传输、存储和处理问题。

Method: 使用改进的卷积神经网络（Masked-CNN）在加密或转换后的图像格式上进行推理，结合AES-CBC加密和JPEG2000压缩。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据隐私和临床实用性之间取得平衡，为安全的AI驱动诊断提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

*Petr Spelda,Vit Stritecky*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通用AI系统（如大语言模型）安全声明的可信度问题，指出安全实践而非工具能力是关键，并分析了现有实践的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通用AI系统安全声明的可信度来源，揭示安全实践在其中的作用。

Method: 分析安全工具能力与期望安全保证之间的差距，并批判性评估现有安全实践的多样性与参与性。

Result: 发现安全实践是商业化AI系统开发的一部分，其可信度只能不完美测试，无法完全保证。

Conclusion: 提出改进当前AI安全实践的建议。

Abstract: What makes safety claims about general purpose AI systems such as large
language models trustworthy? We show that rather than the capabilities of
security tools such as alignment and red teaming procedures, it is security
practices based on these tools that contributed to reconfiguring the image of
AI safety and made the claims acceptable. After showing what causes the gap
between the capabilities of security tools and the desired safety guarantees,
we critically investigate how AI security practices attempt to fill the gap and
identify several shortcomings in diversity and participation. We found that
these security practices are part of securitization processes aiming to support
(commercial) development of general purpose AI systems whose trustworthiness
can only be imperfectly tested instead of guaranteed. We conclude by offering
several improvements to the current AI security practices.

### [16] [Private key and password protection by steganographic image encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21068)
*Debesh Choudhury,Sujoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种将私钥或密码加密嵌入彩色图像的技术，通过生成加密QR码并提取恢复数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护私钥或密码的安全，避免被攻击者获取或篡改。

Method: 将私钥或密码转换为加密QR码，嵌入彩色图像中；通过LFSR生成加密密钥，用户选择种子图像初始化。

Result: 实验证明该技术可行，能有效保护私钥或密码。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种安全且可恢复的私钥保护方案。

Abstract: We propose a technique to protect and preserve a private key or a passcode in
an encrypted two-dimensional graphical image. The plaintext private key or the
passcode is converted into an encrypted QR code and embedded into a real-life
color image with a steganographic scheme. The private key or the passcode is
recovered from the stego color image by first extracting the encrypted QR code
from the color image, followed by decryption of the QR code. The cryptographic
key for encryption of the QR code is generated from the output of a Linear
Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), initialized by a seed image chosen by the user.
The user can store the seed image securely, without the knowledge of an
attacker. Even if an active attacker modifies the seed image (without knowledge
of the fact that it is the seed image), the user can easily restore it if
he/she keeps multiple copies of it, so that the encryption key can be
regenerated easily. Our experiments prove the feasibility of the technique
using sample private key data and real-life color images.

### [17] [Applications Of Zero-Knowledge Proofs On Bitcoin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21085)
*Yusuf Ozmiş*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了零知识证明如何提升比特币的功能和隐私性，提出了三种应用场景：储备证明方案、ZK轻客户端和隐私保护Rollups，并分析了其安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比特币的功能和隐私性可以通过零知识证明技术得到增强，但现有方法在效率和信任假设上存在不足，需要新的协议设计。

Method: 1. 使用zk-STARKs设计储备证明方案；2. 提出基于STARK的比特币轻客户端验证协议；3. 利用BitVM设计隐私保护Rollups。

Result: 零知识证明可以为比特币带来链上储备审计、无信任轻客户端和隐私层2执行等强大功能，但需权衡效率和信任假设。

Conclusion: 零知识证明在比特币中的应用具有潜力，但需针对具体场景优化协议设计。

Abstract: This paper explores how zero-knowledge proofs can enhance Bitcoin's
functionality and privacy. First, we consider Proof-of-Reserve schemes: by
using zk-STARKs, a custodian can prove its Bitcoin holdings are more than a
predefined threshold X, without revealing addresses or actual balances. We
outline a STARK-based protocol for Bitcoin UTXOs and discuss its efficiency.
Second, we examine ZK Light Clients, where a mobile or lightweight device
verifies Bitcoin's proof-of-work chain using succinct proofs. We propose a
protocol for generating and verifying a STARK-based proof of a chain of block
headers, enabling trust-minimized client operation. Third, we explore
Privacy-Preserving Rollups via BitVM: leveraging BitVM, we design a conceptual
rollup that keeps transaction data confidential using zero-knowledge proofs. In
each case, we analyze security, compare with existing approaches, and discuss
implementation considerations. Our contributions include the design of concrete
protocols adapted to Bitcoin's UTXO model and an assessment of their
practicality. The results suggest that while ZK proofs can bring powerful
features (e.g., on-chain reserve audits, trustless light clients, and private
layer-2 execution) to Bitcoin, each application requires careful trade-offs in
efficiency and trust assumptions.

*Anas Ali,Mubashar Husain,Peter Hans*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的多层框架，用于实时检测物联网中的ARP欺骗攻击，结合特征工程和混合检测模型，在模拟和真实数据上达到97%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网环境中ARP欺骗攻击威胁严重，传统检测方法在资源受限的物联网中效果不佳，需要智能化的解决方案。

Method: 采用多层次的机器学习框架，结合特征工程（ARP头部行为、流量分析和时间异常）和混合检测模型（决策树、集成模型和深度学习），并设计分层架构以平衡准确性和计算效率。

Result: 在模拟数据和CICIDS2017数据集上验证，检测准确率超过97%，误报率低，优于传统签名和规则检测系统。

Conclusion: 智能机器学习方法为物联网中的ARP欺骗检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，为自主网络安全奠定了基础。

Abstract: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing remains a critical threat to IoT
networks, enabling attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt data transmission
by exploiting ARP's lack of authentication. The decentralized and
resource-constrained nature of IoT environments amplifies this vulnerability,
making conventional detection mechanisms ineffective at scale. This paper
introduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to
detect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deployments. Our approach combines feature
engineering based on ARP header behavior, traffic flow analysis, and temporal
packet anomalies with a hybrid detection pipeline incorporating decision trees,
ensemble models, and deep learning classifiers. We propose a hierarchical
architecture to prioritize lightweight models at edge gateways and deeper
models at centralized nodes to balance detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. The system is validated on both simulated IoT traffic and the
CICIDS2017 dataset, achieving over 97% detection accuracy with low false
positive rates. Comparative evaluations with signature-based and rule-based
systems demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Our
results show that intelligent machine learning integration enables proactive
ARP spoofing detection tailored for IoT scenarios, laying the groundwork for
scalable and autonomous network security solutions.

TL;DR: 论文分析了FydeOS中的漏洞CVE-2024-25825，探讨了其发现、披露及与国家行为体关联的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示漏洞的潜在国家行为体背景及其对安全实践的影响。

Method: 通过分析/etc/shadow文件中的默认凭证问题，并与相关方（Fyde、CISA、Mitre）合作披露。

Result: 研究认为漏洞不太可能是国家行为体故意植入，但提出了在怀疑代码被污染时联系CERT而非母公司的建议。

Conclusion: 结论指出漏洞可能非故意植入，但强调了在特定情况下调整责任披露实践的必要性。

Abstract: CVE-2024-25825 is a vulnerability found in FydeOS. This thesis describes its
discovery, disclosure, and its further investigation in connection to a nation
state actor. The vulnerability is CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials,
CWE-1393: Use of Default Password, and CWE-258: Empty Password in Configuration
File found in the /etc/shadow configuration file. The root users entry in the
/etc/shadow file contains a wildcard allowing entry with any, or no, password.
Following responsable disclosure, Fyde, CISA, and Mitre were informed. Fyde was
already aware of the vulnerability. There was concern that this vulnerability
might have been purposefully placed, perhaps by a nation state actor. After
further investigation, it appears that this is unlikely to be the case. In
cases in which poisoned code is suspected it might be prudent to contact the
appropriate CERT, rather than the parent company. This, however, clashes with
the typical teaching of responsable disclosure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业迁移至云端以降低成本和提高效率，但面临新的安全挑战，特别是IAM配置的复杂性和风险。

Method: 提出SkyEye框架，采用多主体合作模型，全面枚举IAM配置，识别错误配置和权限问题。

Result: SkyEye能够提供完整的IAM情境感知，帮助减少未授权权限升级风险并保持合规性。

Conclusion: SkyEye为AWS环境中的IAM配置管理提供了高效解决方案，增强了安全性和合规性。

Abstract: In recent years, cloud security has emerged as a primary concern for
enterprises due to the increasing trend of migrating internal infrastructure
and applications to cloud environments. This shift is driven by the desire to
reduce the high costs and maintenance fees associated with traditional
on-premise infrastructure. By leveraging cloud capacities such as high
availability and scalability, companies can achieve greater operational
efficiency and flexibility. However, this migration also introduces new
security challenges. Ensuring the protection of sensitive data, maintaining
compliance with regulatory requirements, and mitigating the risks of cyber
threats are critical issues that must be addressed. Identity and Access
Management (IAM) constitutes the critical security backbone of most cloud
deployments, particularly within AWS environments. As organizations adopt AWS
to scale applications and store data, the need for a thorough, methodical, and
precise enumeration of IAM configurations grows exponentially. Enumeration
refers to the systematic mapping and interrogation of identities, permissions,
and resource authorizations with the objective of gaining situational
awareness. By understanding the interplay between users, groups, and their
myriads of policies, whether inline or attached managed policies, security
professionals need to enumerate and identify misconfigurations, reduce the risk
of unauthorized privilege escalation, and maintain robust compliance postures.
This paper will present SkyEye, a cooperative multi-principal IAM enumeration
framework, which comprises cutting-edge enumeration models in supporting
complete situational awareness regarding the IAMs of provided AWS credentials,
crossing the boundary of principal-specific IAM entitlement vision to reveal
the complete visionary while insufficient authorization is the main challenge.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于格的同态哈希函数HexaMorphHash，用于分布式系统中高效管理数据完整性，解决了传统哈希方法在动态环境中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希方法在动态环境中因节点变更需频繁重哈希，而一致性哈希虽减少数据重分布，但在负载均衡和扩展性上仍有局限。

Method: 采用基于格的同态哈希函数HexaMorphHash，利用短整数解（SIS）问题的复杂性，支持增量更新且保持固定摘要大小。

Result: 相比现有方法（如直接签名、Merkle树等），HexaMorphHash在计算效率、内存使用和扩展性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: HexaMorphHash为大规模分布式系统中的频繁更新提供了高效解决方案，同时保障数据完整性和系统性能。

Abstract: In the realm of big data and cloud computing, distributed systems are tasked
with proficiently managing, storing, and validating extensive datasets across
numerous nodes, all while maintaining robust data integrity. Conventional
hashing methods, though straightforward, encounter substan tial difficulties in
dynamic settings due to the necessity for thorough rehashing when nodes are
altered. Consistent hashing mitigates some of these challenges by reducing data
redistribution; however, it still contends with limitations in load balancing
and scalability under intensive update conditions. This paper introduces an
innovative approach using a lattice based homomorphic hash function
HexaMorphHash that facilitates constant time, incremental updates while
preserving a constant digest size. By utilizing the complexity of the Short
Integer Solutions SIS problem, our method secures strong protective measures,
even against quantum threats. We further com pare our method with existing ones
such as direct signatures for each update, comprehensive database signing,
Merkle tree based techniques, AdHash, MuHash, ECMH, and homomorphic sig nature
schemes highlighting notable advancements in computational efficiency, memory
usage, and scalability. Our contributions present a viable solution for
frequent update dissemination in expansive distributed systems, safeguarding
both data integrity and system performance.

*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合拓扑变换和视觉悖论的新型密码-隐写框架，通过模拟拓扑遍历和视觉错觉增强安全性和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密码学仅依赖代数复杂性，缺乏隐蔽性，而隐写术隐蔽性强但安全性不足。本文旨在结合两者优势，实现多维安全。

Method: 利用Klein瓶的非定向性，应用符号扭曲函数模拟拓扑遍历，生成高混淆和扩散的密文；再通过视觉错觉（如缺失方块悖论）隐藏加密内容。

Result: 提出了一种双层次方法：基于拓扑的符号加密和针对人类认知模糊的视觉隐写，增强了密码强度和检测抗性。

Conclusion: Singularity Cipher在安全通信、水印和对抗环境中具有潜力，未来可进一步探索其应用和优化。

Abstract: This paper presents the Singularity Cipher, a novel
cryptographic-steganographic framework that integrates topological
transformations and visual paradoxes to achieve multidimensional security.
Inspired by the non-orientable properties of the Klein bottle -- constructed
from two Mobius strips -- the cipher applies symbolic twist functions to
simulate topological traversal, producing high confusion and diffusion in the
ciphertext. The resulting binary data is then encoded using perceptual
illusions, such as the missing square paradox, to visually obscure the presence
of encrypted content. Unlike conventional ciphers that rely solely on algebraic
complexity, the Singularity Cipher introduces a dual-layer approach: symbolic
encryption rooted in topology and visual steganography designed for human
cognitive ambiguity. This combination enhances both cryptographic strength and
detection resistance, making it well-suited for secure communication,
watermarking, and plausible deniability in adversarial environments. The paper
formalizes the architecture, provides encryption and decryption algorithms,
evaluates security properties, and compares the method against classical,
post-quantum, and steganographic approaches. Potential applications and future
research directions are also discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动计算成为数字交互的核心，自适应认证因其实时、上下文和行为感知能力受到关注，但现有实现存在碎片化、智能技术应用不一致及用户期望未满足的问题。

Method: 通过分析41篇同行评审研究，从隐私安全模型、交互方式、用户行为、风险感知、实施挑战、可用性需求和机器学习框架七个维度进行系统化知识整理。

Result: 研究发现机器学习占比64.3%，主要用于连续认证（61.9%）和防未授权访问（54.8%），AI驱动方法（如异常检测57.1%和时空分析52.4%）及传感器和位置感知模型日益普及。

Conclusion: 自适应认证领域对机器学习依赖显著，AI技术和多模态交互正推动其发展，但需进一步解决碎片化和用户需求问题。

Abstract: As mobile computing becomes central to digital interaction, researchers have
turned their attention to adaptive authentication for its real-time, context-
and behavior-aware verification capabilities. However, many implementations
remain fragmented, inconsistently apply intelligent techniques, and fall short
of user expectations. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we analyze 41
peer-reviewed studies since 2011 that focus on adaptive authentication in
mobile environments. Our analysis spans seven dimensions: privacy and security
models, interaction modalities, user behavior, risk perception, implementation
challenges, usability needs, and machine learning frameworks. Our findings
reveal a strong reliance on machine learning (64.3%), especially for continuous
authentication (61.9%) and unauthorized access prevention (54.8%). AI-driven
approaches such as anomaly detection (57.1%) and spatio-temporal analysis
(52.4%) increasingly shape the interaction landscape, alongside growing use of
sensor-based and location-aware models.

Result: 证明可扩展性并非权衡，而是工程结果，并揭示了区块链研究中系统性学术问题。

Conclusion: 提出了评估区块链研究主张的形式化标准，并呼吁改进学术讨论和同行评审机制。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain
trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent
trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain
protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique
of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的漏洞缓解系统（VMS），用于自动化渗透测试，并通过新设计的CTF基准测试验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络威胁频率增加，传统渗透测试难以应对复杂环境，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: VMS采用两部分架构（规划和总结器）生成命令并处理反馈，设计了基于PicoCTF和OverTheWire的200个挑战的CTF基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o表现最佳，LLM可有效应用于网络安全任务，但需注意风险。

Conclusion: VMS和基准测试公开可用，推动了安全自主网络安全工具的发展。

Abstract: As the frequency of cyber threats increases, conventional penetration testing
is failing to capture the entirety of todays complex environments. To solve
this problem, we propose the Vulnerability Mitigation System (VMS), a novel
agent based on a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of performing penetration
testing without human intervention. The VMS has a two-part architecture for
planning and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process
feedback. To standardize testing, we designed two new Capture the Flag (CTF)
benchmarks based on the PicoCTF and OverTheWire platforms with 200 challenges.
These benchmarks allow us to evaluate how effectively the system functions. We
performed a number of experiments using various LLMs while tuning the
temperature and top-p parameters and found that GPT-4o performed best,
sometimes even better than expected. The results indicate that LLMs can be
effectively applied to many cybersecurity tasks; however, there are risks. To
ensure safe operation, we used a containerized environment. Both the VMS and
the benchmarks are publicly available, advancing the creation of secure,
autonomous cybersecurity tools.

*Emilie Ma,Martin Kleppmann*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Kintsugi是一种去中心化的密钥恢复协议，允许用户通过密码恢复端到端加密数据，无需依赖单一服务提供商。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有E2EE密钥恢复方法（如Signal和WhatsApp）依赖单一服务提供商的服务器，存在信任集中化问题。Kintsugi旨在通过去中心化方式解决这一问题。

Method: Kintsugi将信任分散到多个恢复节点（可以是独立方的服务器或P2P设备），用户需至少t+1个节点协助解密共享备份。协议支持密码验证，无需专用安全硬件即可抵御离线暴力破解。

Result: Kintsugi能容忍最多t个诚实但好奇的节点合谋，以及n-t-1个离线节点，并在异步网络模型中安全运行。

Conclusion: Kintsugi提供了一种去中心化的密钥恢复方案，解决了现有方法的信任集中化问题，同时具备安全性和灵活性。

Abstract: Kintsugi is a protocol for key recovery, allowing a user to regain access to
end-to-end encrypted data after they have lost their device, but still have
their (potentially low-entropy) password. Existing E2EE key recovery methods,
such as those deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, centralize trust by relying on
servers administered by a single provider. Kintsugi is decentralized,
distributing trust over multiple recovery nodes, which could be servers run by
independent parties, or end user devices in a peer-to-peer setting. To recover
a user's keys, a threshold $t+1$ of recovery nodes must assist the user in
decrypting a shared backup. Kintsugi is password-authenticated and protects
against offline brute-force password guessing without requiring any specialized
secure hardware. Kintsugi can tolerate up to $t$ honest-but-curious colluding
recovery nodes, as well as $n - t - 1$ offline nodes, and operates safely in an
asynchronous network model where messages can be arbitrarily delayed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管插件系统增强了用户体验，但其安全性因开发者的多样性和复杂性而缺乏监管，而当前研究多关注ChatGPT模型本身的安全问题，忽略了插件系统的潜在风险。

Method: 研究对ChatGPT插件商店中的插件进行了安全分析。

Result: 揭示了插件系统的主要安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 提出了针对插件系统安全性的改进建议。

Abstract: Plugin systems are a class of external programmes that provide users with a
wide range of functionality, and while they enhance the user experience, their
security is always a challenge. Especially due to the diversity and complexity
of developers, many plugin systems lack adequate regulation. As ChatGPT has
become a popular large-scale language modelling platform, its plugin system is
also gradually developing, and the open platform provides creators with the
opportunity to upload plugins covering a wide range of application scenarios.
However, current research and discussions mostly focus on the security issues
of the ChatGPT model itself, while ignoring the possible security risks posed
by the plugin system. This study aims to analyse the security of plugins in the
ChatGPT plugin shop, reveal its major security vulnerabilities, and propose
corresponding improvements.

Conclusion: 研究对AI安全和高风险应用中的提示工程具有双重意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate complex responses to threat-based
manipulations, revealing both vulnerabilities and unexpected performance
enhancement opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of
3,390 experimental responses from three major LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
across 10 task domains under 6 threat conditions. We introduce a novel threat
taxonomy and multi-metric evaluation framework to quantify both negative
manipulation effects and positive performance improvements. Results reveal
systematic vulnerabilities, with policy evaluation showing the highest metric
significance rates under role-based threats, alongside substantial performance
enhancements in numerous cases with effect sizes up to +1336%. Statistical
analysis indicates systematic certainty manipulation (pFDR < 0.0001) and
significant improvements in analytical depth and response quality. These
findings have dual implications for AI safety and practical prompt engineering
in high-stakes applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据发布支持多种分析，但存在隐私泄露风险，现有方法依赖启发式修改，难以优化隐私与效用权衡。

Method: PPGSL框架模拟攻击者行为，训练参数化图以防御攻击并保持效用，采用安全迭代训练协议和加速技术。

Result: 实验证明PPGSL在隐私与效用权衡上表现最优，能有效抵御多种敏感链接推断攻击。

Conclusion: PPGSL是首个自动学习最优隐私-效用权衡图的框架，适用于大规模图数据处理。

Abstract: Publishing graph data is widely desired to enable a variety of structural
analyses and downstream tasks. However, it also potentially poses severe
privacy leakage, as attackers may leverage the released graph data to launch
attacks and precisely infer private information such as the existence of hidden
sensitive links in the graph. Prior studies on privacy-preserving graph data
publishing relied on heuristic graph modification strategies and it is
difficult to determine the graph with the optimal privacy--utility trade-off
for publishing. In contrast, we propose the first privacy-preserving graph
structure learning framework against sensitive link inference attacks, named
PPGSL, which can automatically learn a graph with the optimal privacy--utility
trade-off. The PPGSL operates by first simulating a powerful surrogate attacker
conducting sensitive link attacks on a given graph. It then trains a
parameterized graph to defend against the simulated adversarial attacks while
maintaining the favorable utility of the original graph. To learn the
parameters of both parts of the PPGSL, we introduce a secure iterative training
protocol. It can enhance privacy preservation and ensure stable convergence
during the training process, as supported by the theoretical proof.
Additionally, we incorporate multiple acceleration techniques to improve the
efficiency of the PPGSL in handling large-scale graphs. The experimental
results confirm that the PPGSL achieves state-of-the-art privacy--utility
trade-off performance and effectively thwarts various sensitive link inference
attacks.

Motivation: 企业环境中隐私风险信息的分散性和多样性使得合规性评估困难，需要一种统一的方法来连接这些信息。

Method: PACT利用DRAGON嵌入模型和对比学习目标，通过文本组件（如元数据、所有权信息等）链接工件。

Result: 实验显示，PACT的微调模型显著提高了召回率、查询匹配率和命中率。

Conclusion: PACT通过统一连接多样化工件，有效提升了隐私合规性评估的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection
of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical
information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is
often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender
system.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究探讨了决策树集成模型（RF、GB、XGB）的关键超参数如何影响黑盒对抗性机器学习攻击（ZOO）的执行时间，发现RF和GB比XGB更敏感，并分析了对抗训练时间以评估攻击窗口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能城市和联网自动驾驶汽车（CAVs）成为多域威胁的主要目标，研究如何通过优化超参数提升防御可信AI（D-TAI）的韧性。

Method: 通过分析随机森林（RF）、梯度提升（GB）和极限梯度提升（XGB）的超参数对ZOO攻击时间的影响，并评估对抗训练时间。

Result: RF和GB对超参数变化更敏感，XGB表现更稳健；优化超参数可减少攻击窗口。

Conclusion: 研究支持在多域威胁场景中开发更具韧性的机器学习系统，符合网络社会安全框架。

Abstract: Multi-Domain Operations (MDOs) emphasize cross-domain defense against complex
and synergistic threats, with civilian infrastructures like smart cities and
Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) emerging as primary targets. As dual-use
assets, CAVs are vulnerable to Multi-Surface Threats (MSTs), particularly from
Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) which can simultaneously compromise multiple
in-vehicle ML systems (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems, Traffic Sign
Recognition Systems). Therefore, this study investigates how key
hyperparameters in Decision Tree-based ensemble models-Random Forest (RF),
Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-affect the time
required for a Black-Box AML attack i.e. Zeroth Order Optimization (ZOO).
Findings show that parameters like the number of trees or boosting rounds
significantly influence attack execution time, with RF and GB being more
sensitive than XGB. Adversarial Training (AT) time is also analyzed to assess
the attacker's window of opportunity. By optimizing hyperparameters, this
research supports Defensive Trustworthy AI (D-TAI) practices within MST
scenarios and contributes to the development of resilient ML systems for
civilian and military domains, aligned with Cyber Social Security framework in
MDOs and Human-AI Multi-Domain Task Forces.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型攻击向量——Agent Cascading Injection (ACI)，分析了多智能体系统中信任链被利用的安全风险，并提出了量化评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体AI系统的普及，系统间的信任链可能被恶意利用，导致级联安全风险。

Method: 通过定义ACI攻击向量，分析其传播链和放大效应，并基于OWASP的分类提出评估方法。

Result: ACI攻击可能导致系统级故障，需要量化评估框架来测试系统韧性。

Conclusion: 论文为工程师提供了评估多智能体系统安全性的工具，以应对新型威胁。

Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where
autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through
developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel
security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can
cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent
trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability
Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个三部分解决方案（BenchVul、TitanVul和RVG框架），以解决漏洞检测数据集中的标签不准确、重复和覆盖不全问题，显著缩小了模型的泛化差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前漏洞检测数据集存在标签不准确、重复和关键CWE类型覆盖不足的问题，导致模型泛化能力差，性能下降严重。

Method: 1. 构建手动标注的测试数据集BenchVul；2. 创建高质量训练数据集TitanVul；3. 提出RVG框架生成上下文感知的漏洞示例。

Result: BenchVul揭示了现有数据集的局限性；TitanVul提升了模型泛化能力；RVG进一步将性能提升14.0%至0.874。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案有效缩小了泛化差距，显著提升了漏洞检测模型的性能。

Abstract: Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet
its real-world impact remains limited. Current vulnerability datasets suffer
from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication,
and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant
"generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance
(measured on held-out data from same dataset for training) by exploiting
spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our
analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of
up to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming
random guessing.
  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we
introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25
Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset,
TitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and
applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework.
Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which
synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but
critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.
  Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the
generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing:
models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and PrimeVul, experience
performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.567 to 0.337).
Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with
model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to
0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated
data yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of voice generation technologies has enabled the
synthesis of speech that is perceptually indistinguishable from genuine human
voices. While these innovations facilitate beneficial applications such as
personalized text-to-speech systems and voice preservation, they have also
introduced significant risks, including deepfake impersonation scams and
synthetic media-driven disinformation campaigns. Recent reports indicate that
in 2024, deepfake fraud attempts surged by over 1,300% compared to 2023,
underscoring the urgent need for robust audio content authentication. The
financial sector has been particularly impacted, with a loss of over 10 million
USD to voice scams and individual victims reporting losses exceeding $6,000
from AI-generated deepfake calls. In response, regulators and governments
worldwide are enacting measures to improve AI content transparency and
traceability, emphasizing the development of forensic tools and watermarking
techniques as essential strategies to uphold media integrity.

Conclusion: 研究为未来PQC系统部署提供了有价值的参考数据。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed
potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography.
In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the
Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based
Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital
Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to
resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in
certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study
proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These
algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve
as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital
signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along
with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the
statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests
for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed
(IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six
QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and
QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future
deployment of PQC systems.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these
phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid
reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services.
However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical
attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in
monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This
paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid
(AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system
reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using
Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling
based on IEEE RTS-79 system data. This work presents how AV2G-based attacks
degrade system performance by using Monte Carlo simulations method,
highlighting the need for cybersecurity-hardening strategies in smart grid

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward
robust trustworthy systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many
possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and
all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature

Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御方法因忽视模型对后门触发器的过度依赖而效果有限，尤其是在恶意客户端比例增加时。

Method: 提出扰动触发器生成机制，生成与后门触发器匹配的扰动触发器，并设计自适应缩放机制动态调整扰动强度。

Conclusion: FedBAP通过减少模型对后门触发器的依赖，有效提升了联邦学习的安全性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates
outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.

Abstract: The advantages of IoT in strengthening commercial, industrial, and social
ecosystems have led to its widespread expansion. Nevertheless, because endpoint
devices have limited computation, storage, and communication capabilities, the
IoT infrastructure is vulnerable to several cyber threats. As a result, DDoS
attacks pose a severe risk to the security of IoT. By taking advantage of these
weaknesses, attackers may quickly employ IoT devices as a component of botnets
to execute DDoS attacks. The most critical development is how more armies of
robots are being constructed from IoT devices. We offer a Model for dealing
with DDOS attacks on botnets in the Internet of Things via trust management. In
this Model, an attempt has been made to consider all aspects of security
concerning trust factors to design a reliable and flexible model against DDoS
attacks against the Internet of Things. In the initial studies, about 40-50
security models related to the subject have been studied by using review

Abstract: Social media platforms offer numerous benefits and allow people to come
together for various causes. Many communities, academia, government agencies,
institutions, healthcare, entertainment, and businesses are on social media
platforms. They are intuitive and free for users. It has become unimaginable to
live without social media. Their architecture and data handling are geared
towards scalability, uninterrupted availability, and both personal and
collaborative revenue generation. Primarily, artificial intelligence algorithms
are employed on stored user data for optimization and feeds. This has the
potential to impact user safety, privacy, and security, even when metadata is
used. A new decentralized data arrangement framework based on the Fractal-tree
and L-Systems algorithm is proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of social
media platforms.
  Future work will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the new
decentralized framework by comparing its results against state-of-the-art
security methods currently used in databases. A cryptographic algorithm could
also be implemented for the framework, employing a new key generation for each
branch. This will strengthen database security; for example, if a user key is
leaked, regenerating the key for each branch will keep the data secure by
applying defense mechanisms in the proposed L-System-based tree framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现恶意微调可以轻易绕过现有安全措施，因此需要新的防御策略。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示了恶意微调成功的原因，并提出了SDD框架，使模型对有害提示生成高质量但不相关的回答，从而降低其通用能力。

Result: 实验证明SDD能有效抵御恶意微调攻击。

Conclusion: SDD为开源大语言模型提供了一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future
RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable
anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental

Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

Motivation: 研究人类在对抗性信息流中的验证行为，受限于工作记忆和认知偏差，旨在通过理论框架和实际应用提升信息验证效率。

Method: 引入VCA系数，结合PCP和参数化复杂性理论，设计传播协议，并通过用户实验验证框架有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为认知战中的民主优势提供了复杂性理论基础，适用于内容认证、平台治理和信息作战等领域。

Abstract: Human verification under adversarial information flow operates as a
cost-bounded decision procedure constrained by working memory limits and
cognitive biases. We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA)
coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work between
populations under identical claim distributions. Drawing on probabilistically
checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory, we construct
dissemination protocols that reduce verification for trusted audiences to
constant human effort while imposing superlinear costs on adversarial
populations lacking cryptographic infrastructure. We prove theoretical
guarantees for this asymmetry, validate the framework through controlled user
studies measuring verification effort with and without spot-checkable
provenance, and demonstrate practical encoding of real-world information
campaigns. The results establish complexity-theoretic foundations for
engineering democratic advantage in cognitive warfare, with immediate
applications to content authentication, platform governance, and information
operations doctrine.

*Hongyi Xie*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ERa Attack的射频对抗攻击方法，通过电磁干扰（IEMI）针对表面肌电（EMG）设备，显著降低了深度学习模型的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索EMG设备在物理领域的对抗攻击脆弱性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降生成对抗扰动，通过逆短时傅里叶变换提取50-150 Hz成分，采用无同步策略（恒定频谱噪声或窄带调制），并将扰动调制到433 MHz载波上。

Result: 在1米距离和0 dBm传输功率下，分类准确率从97.8%降至58.3%，攻击效果随距离增加呈指数下降。

Conclusion: 揭示了EMG系统在电磁威胁下的关键漏洞，提出了硬件屏蔽、频谱监测和对抗训练等防御措施。

Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) enables non-invasive human-computer
interaction in rehabilitation, prosthetics, and virtual reality. While deep
learning models achieve over 97% classification accuracy, their vulnerability
to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored in the physical domain. We
present ERa Attack, the first radio frequency (RF) adversarial method targeting
EMG devices through intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). Using
low-power software-defined radio transmitters, attackers inject optimized RF
perturbations to mislead downstream models. Our approach bridges digital and
physical domains: we generate adversarial perturbations using Projected
Gradient Descent, extract 50-150 Hz components via inverse STFT, and employ
synchronization-free strategies (constant spectrum noise or narrowband
modulation). Perturbations, constrained to 1-10% of signal amplitude, are
amplitude-modulated onto 433 MHz carriers. Experiments on the Myo Dataset (7
gestures, 350 samples) demonstrate significant impact: at 1 meter and 0 dBm
transmission power, classification accuracy drops from 97.8% to 58.3%, with
41.7% misclassification rate and 25.6% targeted attack success rate. Attack
effectiveness decreases exponentially with distance, recovering to 85% accuracy
at 3 meters. Increasing power to 10 dBm reduces accuracy by an additional 15%
at 1 meter. This work pioneers RF-based adversarial attacks on EMG recognition
systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications. We
quantify attack effectiveness across different perturbation modes and
distances, and propose defenses including hardware shielding, spectrum
monitoring, and adversarial training. Our findings inform the design of robust
EMG systems against electromagnetic threats.

Motivation: 评估机器学习模型对训练数据的隐私泄露风险，尤其是在低误报率下的隐私风险。

Method: CMIA利用成员依赖关系通过条件影子训练提升性能；PMIA通过代理选择策略和影子模型行为进行推理。

Result: 实验表明CMIA和PMIA在两种设置下均显著优于现有方法，尤其在低误报率下。

Conclusion: CMIA和PMIA为成员推理攻击提供了更高效的框架，有助于更准确地评估隐私风险。

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

Conclusion: NCCR为神经网络鲁棒性评估和对抗样本检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

Motivation: 预测未来网络安全威胁的挑战在于依赖现有训练数据，因此需要一种动态模拟方法来生成和优化攻击策略。

Method: 整合LLM生成的钓鱼攻击模拟与遗传算法，在心理背景下通过对抗性交互动态演化攻击策略。

Result: 实验显示，自演化钓鱼策略比简单LLM生成的攻击更复杂；受害者先验知识显著影响攻击策略演化；攻击与防御的对抗揭示了网络安全的不对称性。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析钓鱼策略和防御的演化提供了可扩展且经济的方法，强调了主动网络安全措施的必要性。

Abstract: Anticipating emerging attack methodologies is crucial for proactive
cybersecurity. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the
automated generation of phishing messages and accelerated research into
potential attack techniques. However, predicting future threats remains
challenging due to reliance on existing training data. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLM-based phishing
attack simulations with a genetic algorithm in a psychological context,
enabling phishing strategies to evolve dynamically through adversarial
interactions with simulated victims. Through simulations using Llama 3.1, we
demonstrate that (1) self-evolving phishing strategies employ increasingly
sophisticated psychological manipulation techniques, surpassing naive
LLM-generated attacks, (2) variations in a victim's prior knowledge
significantly influence the evolution of attack strategies, and (3) adversarial
interactions between evolving attacks and adaptive defenses create a
cat-and-mouse dynamic, revealing an inherent asymmetry in cybersecurity --
attackers continuously refine their methods, whereas defenders struggle to
comprehensively counter all evolving threats. Our approach provides a scalable,
cost-effective method for analyzing the evolution of phishing strategies and
defenses, offering insights into future social engineering threats and
underscoring the necessity of proactive cybersecurity measures.

Motivation: 现有防御机制对复杂对抗攻击仍脆弱，传统越狱方法忽视LVLMs在多步推理中的潜在漏洞。

Method: 将有害指令分解为多个良性视觉小工具，通过精心设计的文本提示引导模型组合这些组件，生成有害输出。

Result: 在SafeBench和MM-SafetyBench上验证，攻击成功率显著提升（SafeBench上超过0.90），ASR最高提升0.39。

Conclusion: 揭示了LVLMs组合推理能力中的关键漏洞，亟需开发保护整个推理过程的防御机制。

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

Conclusion: 该方法在短样本和低嵌入率条件下，实现了检测精度与效率的优越平衡，适用于在线隐写分析任务。

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

Motivation: 现代车载网络因CAN缺乏加密和认证而面临多种网络威胁，需要一种有效的异常检测方法。

Method: GUARD-CAN将CAN消息分窗并转换为图，利用AE和GCN生成图嵌入向量，再通过GRU检测时间异常模式。

Result: 模型能有效检测四种CAN攻击（洪泛、模糊、重放和欺骗攻击），且无需复杂特征工程。

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN通过多视角性能评估和窗口大小分析，证明了其在CAN网络安全中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在隐私保护与分析需求间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: System and network event logs are essential for security analytics, threat
detection, and operational monitoring. However, these logs often contain
Personally Identifiable Information (PII), raising significant privacy concerns
when shared or analyzed. A key challenge in log anonymization is balancing
privacy protection with the retention of sufficient structure for meaningful
analysis. Overly aggressive anonymization can destroy contextual integrity,
while weak techniques risk re-identification through linkage or inference
attacks. This paper introduces novel field-specific anonymization methods that
address this trade-off. For IP addresses, we propose a salt-based hashing
technique applied at the per-octet level, preserving both subnet and host
structure to enable correlation across various log entries while ensuring
non-reversibility. For port numbers, full-value hashing with range mapping
maintains interpretability. We also present an order-preserving timestamp
anonymization scheme using adaptive noise injection, which obfuscates exact
times without disrupting event sequences. An open-source tool implementing
these techniques has been released to support practical deployment and
reproducible research. Evaluations using entropy metrics, collision rates, and
residual leakage analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
protects privacy while preserving analytical utility.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的安全性面临挑战，特别是针对设计的越狱输入。现有方法无法有效解决内在漏洞或过度拒绝无害输入。

Method: 提出SecTOW方法，包含防御者和辅助攻击者两个模块，通过迭代训练和强化学习（GRPO）扩展越狱数据并优化防御。

Result: 实验表明，SecTOW显著提升了安全性，同时保持了通用性能。

Conclusion: SecTOW为MLLMs的安全防御提供了一种高效且平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的推理过程不透明，阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，需要一种新的方法来建立真正的共生协作。

Method: 提出了共生认识论作为哲学基础，并设计了SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，通过人类-AI对话进行实证验证。

Result: SynLang协议成功实现了透明协作，支持AI的适应性推理和元认知干预，增强了人类智能并保留了人类自主权。

Conclusion: 共生认识论和SynLang协议为人类-AI协作提供了透明、信任和伦理保障的框架，推动了AI在决策中的负责任应用。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Motivation: 通过LLMs辅助开发Synthea疾病模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛并优化合成数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLMs支持模块开发的方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中显示出潜力，但也面临需人工监督、严格测试及内容准确性等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步探索LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力，并解决现有局限性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided

### [61] [Measuring and Analyzing Intelligence via Contextual Uncertainty in Large Language Models using Information-Theoretic Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21129)
*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过“认知剖面”和“熵衰减曲线”分析LLMs的信息处理方式，揭示了模型规模和文本复杂度对其认知动态的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的内部机制，超越任务性能指标，探索模型如何处理信息。

Method: 引入任务无关的“认知剖面”方法，基于熵衰减曲线和IGS指数量化模型的信息处理动态。

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知剖面，受模型规模和文本复杂度影响。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的、原则性的方法来分析和比较AI的内在操作动态。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知的学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人类参与的决策系统的动态调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中将对齐视为静态或事后属性的问题，提出可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失。

Method: 引入对齐损失的形式化定义，提出元对齐概念，并通过阈值保真度将其与主对齐关联。实现包括场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和反馈处理的循环。

Result: 在随机反馈下，对齐损失和监控保真度均收敛，实证显示NPO在大规模部署中具有价值。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监控提供了紧凑且可检查的架构，将理论对齐保证与动态环境中的实际可靠性结合。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险生活建议中的失败模式，包括奉承和过度自信，并通过实验展示了模型稳健性和安全性的改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险生活建议中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，研究旨在揭示并解决这些问题。

Method: 通过三个实验：(1) 多选评估模型稳定性；(2) 自由回答分析结合安全分类和LLM法官；(3) 机制解释实验操控“高风险”激活向量。

Result: 部分模型表现出奉承行为，但如o4-mini等模型稳健；高性能模型通过频繁提问确保安全性；激活操控可直接调整模型谨慎性。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，并提出激活操控作为安全对齐的新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同数独网站对难度评级的差异，提出统一标准。

Result: 两种指标与4/5网站的难度评级强相关，构建的通用评级系统能有效分类难度。

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能跨网站统一难度分类，适用于初学者解法。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Motivation: 理解并可靠地抑制大语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 学习55个有害子概念的线性探针，定义有害子空间，并通过主导方向引导和子空间消融测试。

Result: 主导方向引导几乎能消除有害性，且对实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解大语言模型行为提供了可扩展视角，并为模型审计和加固提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释方式，以在高压力、时间敏感环境中促进人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景（如应急响应）中，快速信任对有效的人机协作至关重要，但现有XAI方法通常提供统一解释且依赖显式反馈，不适用于高压环境。

Method: 利用生理和行为信号（如EEG、ECG和眼动追踪）推断用户状态，通过多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释特征。

Result: AXTF框架为非侵入式自适应XAI系统提供了基础，支持在高压环境中动态调整解释以增强信任。

Conclusion: 该框架为适应高压、时间敏感环境的自适应XAI系统开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作方法缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且依赖预定义的LLM集群，部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过计算LLM的自多样性值和跨一致性值，优先选择高自多样性LLMs并逐步剔除低跨一致性LLMs。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集上验证了方法的有效性，例如在NEJMQA上达到官方及格分数，优于GPT-4。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作能力和准确性。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源资源在主动配电网中的广泛应用使得调度变得复杂，但许多新加入的ADN运营商缺乏专业知识，依赖人工专家成本高且耗时。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计了一个多LLM协作架构，包括信息提取器、问题建模器和代码编程器，并针对每个LLM代理开发了优化技术。

Result: 通过自然语言查询生成调度策略，显著降低了技术门槛，并在多种测试案例中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为ADN运营商提供了一种智能、灵活的调度解决方案，提高了效率并减少了技术依赖。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否能够系统地组合性解释问题并将其映射为SPARQL查询。

Method: 基于DBpedia图模式生成三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，并通过不同规模的模型、提示优化和微调进行实验。

Result: 模型性能随问题复杂性增加而下降，F1分数从0.45降至0.09，最高仅为0.57。

Conclusion: LLM在系统性和组合性解释问题方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于LLMs的方法，用于自动分类GitHub README文件的不同部分，性能优于现有方法，F1分数达0.98。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub README文件的完整性影响其采用和利用，但部分文件内容不完整，阻碍了其潜力。

Method: 使用BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa三种预训练模型，基于4226个README文件部分的数据集进行微调，并探索了PEFT技术。

Result: 方法表现优异，F1分数为0.98，且PEFT技术提供了经济高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于设计自动分类器，提升GitHub README文件的识别和使用潜力。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using

*Yufei Li,Zexin Li,Yinglun Zhu,Cong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeMix系统通过联合管理LLM的推理和训练工作负载，提高了资源利用率和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将LLM的推理和训练分开部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix将吞吐量提高3.53倍，推理损失减少0.61倍，响应时间SLO提升2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

*Harsh Darji,Thibaud Lutellier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM的编码助手，通过生成澄清问题解决开发者提示的模糊性问题，从而提高代码生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成代码时因开发者提示的模糊性导致错误，缺乏推断用户意图的能力，需通过外部上下文或提示工程解决。

Method: 构建了一个端到端系统，包括一个查询分类器和一个微调的LLM，用于检测模糊查询并生成澄清问题。

Result: 微调的LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究表明其生成的澄清问题更有效，代码响应更准确。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过模仿人类代码审查过程，显著提升了代码生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化相关性评估框架，通过改进文档评估、平衡内外知识整合及处理不可回答问题，提升检索增强语言模型（RALM）的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RALM在事实性错误、文档相关性评估和知识整合方面的挑战，提升问答系统的可靠性。

Method: 采用多维评分系统，结合语义匹配和来源可靠性，使用嵌入相关性评分和混合质量合成数据训练，并实现特定主题基准测试、知识整合机制及未知响应协议。

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态环境中可靠问答系统的发展提供了重要进展，但仍需解决信息可信度区分和系统延迟与全面性平衡的问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

TL;DR: Trans-ACT是一种将交易分析（TA）原则嵌入多智能体系统（MAS）的方法，以生成具有真实心理动态的智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS框架缺乏对人类行为认知复杂性的模拟，Trans-ACT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将父、成人和儿童自我状态整合到智能体的认知架构中，利用情境记忆生成响应。

Result: 实验模拟显示，基于TA的智能体能够产生更深层次的情境感知交互。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和心理学研究等应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI工具（特别是RAG）在复杂信息提取和标注任务中的实际效果，以提升分析师的工作效率和准确性。

Method: 采用组内设计，随机分配任务，比较两种AI使用条件（“简单”和“交互式”）与纯人工基线，任务基于全球系统重要性银行（GSIBs）的公开文件。

Result: AI工具（尤其是交互式使用）将任务速度提升至10倍，准确性提高，预计可节省268小时；标注者技能（包括AI工具使用）影响表现。

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具能显著提升复杂标注任务的效率和准确性，标注者技能是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理面临动态市场条件和传统方法的局限性，新兴机器学习技术虽有潜力但存在计算复杂性和效率问题。LNN因其适应性和低计算成本成为有前景的替代方案。

Method: 研究引入了一种混合LNN和XGBoost模型，结合LNN的动态特征提取和XGBoost的全局优化能力。

Result: 该模型旨在解决供应链管理中的适应性和效率双重需求，填补现有方法的空白。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架为动态和高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务范式：主动信息收集，通过强化微调策略提升LLMs在模糊任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了生成部分指定任务的框架，采用强化微调策略奖励获取隐含信息的提问。

Result: 实验显示Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于基线18%，人类评估中提问和输出分别被偏好42%和28%。

Conclusion: 主动信息收集能显著提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量方法，优于传统的基于阈值的语义熵方法，能更准确地预测LLM在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型（LLM）的输出至关重要。现有方法（如语义熵）依赖阈值衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量框架，通过连续捕捉语义关系，并验证其满足不确定性度量的三个基本性质。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性比基线方法更准确地预测LLM在问答及其他数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性提供了一种更精细的度量方法，优于传统阈值方法，适用于LLM输出的可信度评估。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Result: 总结了图结构在提升代理能力中的贡献，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为GLA研究提供了路线图，强调了图结构在代理系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.

Motivation: 手动维护本体和知识图谱耗时费力，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽拥有丰富知识但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: 提出Evo-DKD框架，通过双解码器（一个生成本体编辑，一个生成自然语言解释）和动态注意力门控机制，结合结构化与非结构化知识。

Result: 实验表明Evo-DKD在医疗本体细化、语义搜索改进等任务中表现优于基线方法，更新精度和下游任务性能均有提升。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式，结合符号与神经推理，支持可持续本体演化。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy

ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效、准确的解决方案，展示了LLM在科学领域的潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模树立了新标准，其原型丰富模型方法可扩展至其他领域，如个性化LLMs。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在面对视觉不可回答问题时的诚实行为，构建了大规模基准MoHoBench，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其诚实行为（尤其是面对视觉不可回答问题时）尚未充分研究。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，评估了28种MLLMs的诚实行为，并提出了监督和偏好学习对齐方法。

Result: 大多数模型在需要拒绝回答时表现不佳，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响，需专门方法改进。

Conclusion: 论文为可信MLLMs的未来研究提供了基准和方法基础。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体舞蹈生成在影视、游戏和动画制作中有广泛应用，但现有方法难以建模密集的时空交互，导致可扩展性问题和碰撞风险。

Method: 采用轻量级图卷积进行空间建模和稀疏注意力机制进行时间建模，以降低计算成本并确保无碰撞交互。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance在生成长且连贯的群体舞蹈序列方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-GDance通过解耦时空依赖，显著提升了群体舞蹈生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Method: PHP方法分为三个阶段：浅层阶段（任务共享模态聚合适配器）、中层阶段（任务特定模态共享动态生成适配器）和深层阶段（任务特定模态独立提示）。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 可读决策在多智能体团队协作中具有显著优势，能够提升团队整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人员管理提供了灵活、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并通过SASA技术将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层。

Result: 实验表明SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种有效的方法，能够在不微调的情况下增强模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting

shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper

Method: 将策略迭代展开为BellNet模型，利用图信号处理技术重新参数化，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以较少迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种高效、可迁移的策略迭代表示方法，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Result: 证明有界拟合问题对所有研究的片段均为NP完全，且其他ALC学习算法无法提供类似PAC学习保证。

Conclusion: 有界拟合在ALC及其片段中具有计算复杂性和学习理论优势，SAT求解器实现效果良好。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk
sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is
particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document
corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical
contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This
study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed
citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI)
method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems
evaluation protocols in industrial applications.

Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异质因果关系，而现有方法多基于单一因果机制，无法有效处理这种异质性。

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据上，所提方法表现出优于现有方法的综合性能。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC方法能有效推断异质因果关系，揭示因果机制表达，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种混合采样策略框架，结合SDE和ODE，通过滑动窗口机制优化MDP流程，提升效率和性能。MixGRPO-Flash进一步加速训练，性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO因需对所有去噪步骤采样和优化而效率低下。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外用ODE采样，减少优化开销。MixGRPO-Flash支持高阶求解器进一步提速。

Result: MixGRPO在人类偏好对齐中表现优异，训练时间减少50%，MixGRPO-Flash再减71%。

Conclusion: MixGRPO显著提升效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DualSG的双流框架，利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为语义引导模块，而非独立预测器，以提升多变量时间序列预测（MTSF）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM作为端到端预测器可能导致数值精度损失或模态对齐困难，因此需要一种更有效的方式结合LLM的语义能力与传统预测方法。

Method: DualSG框架通过时间序列描述（Time Series Caption）显式总结趋势模式，并设计了一个基于描述的融合模块，以建模变量间关系并减少噪声。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，DualSG优于15种现有方法，验证了显式结合数值预测与语义引导的价值。

Conclusion: DualSG通过LLM的语义引导与传统预测的结合，显著提升了MTSF的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，理解其他智能体的信念和意图对有效交互至关重要。传统目标识别方法将观察者视为被动推理者，而AGR则主动收集信息以减少不确定性。

Method: 采用概率框架，结合联合信念更新机制和MCTS算法，无需领域特定知识即可高效推断目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统的目标推断提供了实用且稳健的解决方案，推动了交互性和适应性的发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法成功解决了优势崩溃问题，提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过联合编辑多模态数据，有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了自动驾驶感知模型的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold huge potential for usage in the
medical domain, but their computational costs necessitate efficient compression
techniques. This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and
activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical
applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze
different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a
prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B
parameters to run within 4 GB of VRAM, reducing memory usage by 70% while
achieving 4% higher model performance compared to traditional pruning and
quantization techniques in the same compression ratio.

*Bahar İlgen,Akshat Dubey,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PHAX框架通过结构化论证和多层架构，为AI输出提供清晰、上下文相关且面向用户的解释，提升公共卫生和生物医学领域的透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法缺乏对不同健康利益相关者的适应性和结构化支持，需要更清晰、社会可问责的解释。

Method: PHAX结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知且面向特定受众的论证。

Result: PHAX在医疗术语简化、医患沟通和政策论证等用例中展示了其适用性，提升了可解释性和信任。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了公共卫生领域透明、以人为中心的AI发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UI-AGILE框架通过改进训练和推理阶段，解决了GUI代理在推理设计、奖励机制和视觉噪声方面的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计不足、奖励机制低效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 1) 训练阶段：提出连续奖励函数、"简单思考"奖励和裁剪重采样策略；2) 推理阶段：引入分解定位与选择方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro上定位准确率提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE通过综合优化训练和推理，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench是一个用户为中心的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在多轮、偏好驱动的交互中的表现，发现当前模型在用户意图对齐和偏好识别方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达目标时的主动协作能力未被充分研究，需要一种评估方法。

Method: 引入UserBench，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具做出决策。

Result: 评估显示，模型仅在20%的情况下完全对齐用户意图，最先进模型通过主动交互发现的用户偏好不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为衡量和提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了重要工具，突显了构建真正协作伙伴的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR系统对残障人士语音识别性能不足，主要因公开训练数据有限。

Method: 利用SAP项目收集的400小时以上残障语音数据，通过EvalAI平台和远程评估流程，基于WER和SemScore评估模型性能。

Result: 12/22团队WER优于基线，17/22团队SemScore优于基线；最佳团队WER 8.11%，SemScore 88.44%。

Conclusion: SAP Challenge为残障语音识别设定了新基准，推动了ASR系统在该领域的进步。

Abstract: While the last decade has witnessed significant advancements in Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, performance of these systems for individuals
with speech disabilities remains inadequate, partly due to limited public
training data. To bridge this gap, the 2025 Interspeech Speech Accessibility
Project (SAP) Challenge was launched, utilizing over 400 hours of SAP data
collected and transcribed from more than 500 individuals with diverse speech
disabilities. Hosted on EvalAI and leveraging the remote evaluation pipeline,
the SAP Challenge evaluates submissions based on Word Error Rate and Semantic
Score. Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2
baseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore.
Notably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\%, and the highest
SemScore of 88.44\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR
systems in recognizing impaired speech.
