However,\nrepeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic\nfailures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused\non identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often\ncomplex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in\npractice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test\ncode fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.\nOur method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution\ntrace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely\ninvolved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is\nused to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,\nsystem-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is\napplicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate\nour technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset\nof faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show\nthat our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of\naround 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the\nLLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our\nresults further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance,\nnarrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81%\nhit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9759\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u793aLLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6545\u969c\u6216\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u5931\u8d25\u6267\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u63d0\u793aLLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fee\u526a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u526a\u540e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8f68\u8ff9\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u8fbe90% F1\u5206\u6570\uff0cLLM\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1134%\uff0c\u5757\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728Top-3\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u8fbe81%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6267\u884c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5757\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, it\nis fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code\nincluding library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability\nof underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex\nfeatures remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test\ninputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths\nand often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting\nan LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In\nthis paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic\npath enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates\npossible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an\nexecutable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This\navoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead\nconstructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the\nfirst to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage\nalongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they\nexercise.

Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience", "comment": null, "summary": "Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains\nunderexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the\ncognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,\nleading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum\ngame inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds\nto a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from\nuntrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt\nstyles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament\ngameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to\nrandomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of\nprompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit\nhints.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and\nempirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense\nmechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional\nattack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes.

It\nenables the Ethereum blockchain to execute smart contracts and decentralized\napplications (dApps). The increasing adoption of Ethereum sparked the rise of\nphishing activities. Phishing attacks often target users through deceptive\nmeans, e.g., fake websites, wallet scams, or malicious smart contracts, aiming\nto steal sensitive information or funds. A timely detection of phishing\nactivities in the EVM is therefore crucial to preserve the user trust and\nnetwork integrity. Some state-of-the art approaches to phishing detection in\nsmart contracts rely on the online analysis of transactions and their traces.\nHowever, replaying transactions often exposes sensitive user data and\ninteractions, with several security concerns. In this work, we present\nPhishingHook, a framework that applies machine learning techniques to detect\nphishing activities in smart contracts by directly analyzing the contract's\nbytecode and its constituent opcodes. We evaluate the efficacy of such\ntechniques in identifying malicious patterns, suspicious function calls, or\nanomalous behaviors within the contract's code itself before it is deployed or\ninteracted with.

The\nresults of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter\naccounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and\ncheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08bots\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6076\u610f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5982\u4f20\u64ad\u5783\u573e\u90ae\u4ef6\u548c\u64cd\u7eb5\u516c\u4f17\u8206\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528Twitter\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ecBotometer\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u6570\u3001\u8d26\u6237\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTwitter\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
