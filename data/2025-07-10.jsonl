While research has\nidentified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a\nneed for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice.\nObjective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative\nimportance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the\nchallenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes.\nMethod: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the\nquality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a\nsampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous\nsample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We\ncollected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We\nfound that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability,\nMaintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality\nattributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most\ndivergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the\nsoftware-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the\nimportant attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics,\nlack of an established review process, and lack of external support.\nConclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further\nsupport with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under\ndifferent software testing contexts.

Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts,\nso complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating\nand executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a\ndeveloper's modified version, but fails again after merging with another\ndeveloper's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective\nat detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly\ndue to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and\nEvosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome\nthese limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on\nCode Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests\nusing different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter\nconfigurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler\nsystems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex,\nreal-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in\ndetecting conflicts.

As\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical\napplications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only\nexplicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly\naccessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through\nelaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such\nmethods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially\nconstraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C\nPrompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive\ncomponents: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This\nminimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization\ndirectives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI\ninteractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework\nconsistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich\nand consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic,\nDeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and\nSmall-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources."}

Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing\nSpattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven\nrepresentative defense mechanisms.

However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security\nvulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This\npaper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack\nvectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the\nexploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous\nentities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can\nleverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor\nattacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including\nGPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing\nmalware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals\nan alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct\nprompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical\n82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we\ndiscovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will\nexecute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a\nfundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings\ndemonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all\nattack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security\nbehaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the\nneed to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing\na paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become\nsophisticated attack vectors."}

BarkBeetle\nemploys a bottom-up recovery strategy that uses targeted fault injection at\nspecific nodes to efficiently infer feature splits and threshold values. Our\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that BarkBeetle requires\nsignificantly fewer queries and recovers more structural information compared\nto prior approaches, when evaluated on DTs trained with public UCI datasets. To\nvalidate its practical feasibility, we implement BarkBeetle on a Raspberry Pi\nRP2350 board and perform fault injections using the Faultier voltage glitching\ntool. As BarkBeetle targets general DT models, we also provide an in-depth\ndiscussion on its applicability to a broader range of tree-based applications,\nincluding data stream classification, DT variants, and cryptography schemes."}

However, the model owner\ndoes not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To\nsolve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML\nmodel inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the\nML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The\nsecond method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific\nclass of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built\non top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling\nsuccinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow\nZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to\nspecialized protocols and up to a $6\\times$ speedup in proving time over a\ngeneral-purpose ZKML framework."}
