Safeguarding Open-Source LLMs Against Unauthorized Model Merging", "comment": "Accepted by AAAI 2026 Conference", "summary": "Model merging has emerged as an efficient technique for expanding large language models (LLMs) by integrating specialized expert models. However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging. The core design of MergeBarrier is to disrupt the Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) between the protected model and its homologous counterparts, thereby eliminating the low-loss path required for effective model merging. Extensive experiments show that MergeBarrier effectively prevents model merging stealing with negligible accuracy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "MergeBarrier\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u540c\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7a83\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7a83\u53d6\u7684\u65b0\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u517c\u5bb9\u5f00\u6e90\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMergeBarrier\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u540c\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMergeBarrier\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7a83\u53d6\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "MergeBarrier\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7a83\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose BadThink, the first backdoor attack designed to deliberately induce \"overthinking\" behavior in CoT-enabled LLMs while ensuring stealth. When activated by carefully crafted trigger prompts, BadThink manipulates the model to generate inflated reasoning traces - producing unnecessarily redundant thought processes while preserving the consistency of final outputs. This subtle attack vector creates a covert form of performance degradation that significantly increases computational costs and inference time while remaining difficult to detect through conventional output evaluation methods. We implement this attack through a sophisticated poisoning-based fine-tuning strategy, employing a novel LLM-based iterative optimization process to embed the behavior by generating highly naturalistic poisoned data. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art models and reasoning tasks show that BadThink consistently increases reasoning trace lengths - achieving an over 17x increase on the MATH-500 dataset - while remaining stealthy and robust. This work reveals a critical, previously unexplored vulnerability where reasoning efficiency can be covertly manipulated, demonstrating a new class of sophisticated attacks against CoT-enabled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "BadThink\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5d4c\u5165\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBadThink\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728MATH-500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc717\u500d\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u5148\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5373\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u9690\u853d\u5730\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u9488\u5bf9CoT\u542f\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -\u03a3 p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials).

However, evolving requirements, complex inputs, and legacy dependencies hinder the software quality and maintainability. While peer code review can improve software quality, its adoption by research software engineers (RSEs) remains unexplored. Aims: This study explores RSE perspectives on peer code review, focusing on their practices, challenges, and potential improvements. Building on prior work, it aims to uncover how RSEs insights differ from those of other research software developers and identify factors that can enhance code review adoption in this domain. Method: We surveyed RSEs to gather insights into their perspectives on peer code review. The survey design aligned with previous research to enable comparative analysis while including additional questions tailored to RSEs. Results: We received 61 valid responses from the survey. The findings align with prior research while uncovering unique insights about the challenges and practices of RSEs compared to broader developer groups. Conclusions: Peer code review is vital in improving research software's quality, maintainability, and reliability.

The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \\emph{feasibility-unaware}.\n  In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision.

Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u548cLLM\u5224\u65ad\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5171\u8bc6\u8fbe\u6210\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d(APR)\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u5faa\u73af\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2abug\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5224\u65ad\u8865\u4e01\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5171\u8bc6\u8fbe\u6210Cohen's kappa 0.75\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u73870.94\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u73870.80\u3002\u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aCohen's kappa\u4e3a0.57\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u73870.93\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u73870.65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8865\u4e01\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Armadillo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6297\u7834\u574f\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u5fa1\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u53ea\u53d7\u5408\u6cd5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u3002Armadillo\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6297\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6392\u9664\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "Armadillo\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u4e2d\u4ec5\u97003\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f83\u8f7b\u3002", "conclusion": "Armadillo\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u526a\u679d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u7406\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u76f4\u89c2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u548c\u96be\u5904\u7406\u60c5\u51b5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6240\u9009\u89e3\u96c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u89e3\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to \"unknown unknowns\".\n  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.\n  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.\n  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.\n  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ERTMS/ETCS\u94c1\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8684.775%\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c96.610%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728'\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u672a\u77e5'\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fde\u63a5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u63d2\u88c5\u751f\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u65e5\u5fd7\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728ERTMS/ETCS\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u63d2\u88c5\u8fbe\u523084.775%\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fbe\u523096.610% F1\u5206\u6570\u548c93.515% AUC\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u63d2\u88c5\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, the emergence of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of diffusion-based image editing and robust image watermarking. We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting.

Competitive genres-such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), First Person Shooter (FPS), Real Time Strategy (RTS), and Action games-remain underexplored due to the difficulty of detecting cheating users and the demand for complex data and techniques. To address this gap, many game companies rely on kernel-level anti-cheat solutions, which, while effective, raise serious concerns regarding user privacy and system security. In this paper, we propose GYNOPTICON, a novel cheating detection framework that leverages user consensus to identify abnormal behavior. GYNOPTICON integrates a lightweight client-side detection mechanism with a server-side voting system: when suspicious activity is identified, clients cast votes to the server, which aggregates them to establish consensus and distinguish cheaters from legitimate players. This architecture enables transparency, reduces reliance on intrusive monitoring, and mitigates privacy risks. We evaluate GYNOPTICON in both a controlled simulation and a real-world FPS environment. Simulation results verify its feasibility and requirements, while real-world experiments confirm its effectiveness in reliably detecting cheating users. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's applicability and sustainability for long-term game management using public datasets.

Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB).

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards. We also question whether opaque black-box models are suitable for high-stakes clinical decisions, suggesting a shift toward interpretable systems with verifiable safety guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4ec5\u9700100-500\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u7834\u574f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8560%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u8fbe6-12\u4e2a\u6708\u751a\u81f3\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u7597AI\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u67b6\u6784\u653b\u51fb\uff08CNN\u3001LLM\u3001RL\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u533b\u7597\u6587\u6863\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5668\u5b98\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u5371\u673a\u5206\u8bca\uff09\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5546\u4e1a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u7834\u574f\u533b\u7597AI\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff0c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ef\u5f71\u54cd50-200\u4e2a\u673a\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f6c\u5411\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u56fd\u9645AI\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets. The results show that SCRUTINEER achieves a precision of 80.77%, a recall of 82.35%, and an F1-score of 81.55% in detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCRUTINEER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6(SCRs)\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u3001RAG\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6(SCRs)\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u903b\u8f91\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdd\u89c4\u65e5\u76ca\u6210\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u53d6\u903b\u8f91\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1RAG\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u5feb\u7167\u63a8\u7406\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cSCRUTINEER\u5728\u68c0\u6d4bSCRs\u903b\u8f91\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdd\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523080.77%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u300182.35%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c81.55%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "SCRUTINEER\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Neither meets 5G New Radio (NR)-V2X's stringent requirements for both immediate authentication and computational efficiency. This paper presents SALT-V, a novel hybrid authentication framework that reconciles this fundamental trade-off through intelligent protocol stratification. SALT-V employs ECDSA signatures for 10% of traffic (BOOT frames) to establish sender trust, then leverages this trust anchor to authenticate 90% of messages (DATA frames) using lightweight GMAC operations. The core innovation - an Ephemeral Session Tag (EST) whitelist mechanism - enables 95% of messages to achieve immediate verification without waiting for key disclosure, while Bloom filter integration provides O(1) revocation checking in 1 us. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SALT-V achieves 0.035 ms average computation time (57x faster than pure ECDSA), 1 ms end-to-end latency, 41-byte overhead, and linear scalability to 2000 vehicles, making it the first practical solution to satisfy all safety-critical requirements for real-time V2X deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SALT-V\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ECDSA\u548cGMAC\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u79d2\u7ea7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfV2X\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77db\u76fe\uff1aECDSA\u5b89\u5168\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff082ms\uff09\uff0cTESLA\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u5bc6\u94a5\u62ab\u9732\u5ef6\u8fdf\u957f\uff0820-100ms\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db35G NR-V2X\u5bf9\u5373\u65f6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a10%\u6d41\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528ECDSA\u7b7e\u540d\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\u951a\u70b9\uff0c90%\u6d88\u606f\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7GMAC\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5305\u62ec\u4e34\u65f6\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6807\u7b7e\u767d\u540d\u5355\u673a\u5236\u548cBloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b095%\u6d88\u606f\u5373\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c1us\u64a4\u9500\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f40.035ms\uff08\u6bd4\u7eafECDSA\u5feb57\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf1ms\uff0c\u5f00\u950041\u5b57\u8282\uff0c\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u52302000\u8f86\u8f66\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6V2X\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "SALT-V\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86V2X\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6V2X\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines.

However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C. While the tool is not yet qualified under DO-330 (Tool Qualification), findings suggest that when tailored appropriately, Agile methods can not only coexist with the requirements of safety-system development and certification in highly regulated domains like aerospace, but also add efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCertiA360\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u878d\u5165\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u53d8\u66f4\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u8ffd\u6eaf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b26\u5408DO-178C\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fDO-178C\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u5316\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u8ffd\u6eaf\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1CertiA360\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u884c\u4e1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u53d8\u66f4\u8ffd\u6eaf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b26\u5408\u76d1\u7ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u786e\u4fddDO-178C\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5de5\u5177\u5c1a\u672a\u901a\u8fc7DO-330\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u5b9a\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u7b49\u9ad8\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset.

In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parties, i.e., pooled normalization. Local normalization can be problematic when data distributions across parties are non-IID, while the pooled normalization approach conflicts with the decentralized nature of FL. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of widely used normalization techniques to FL and define the term federated normalization. Federated normalization simulates pooled normalization by enabling the collaborative exchange of normalization parameters among parties. Thus, it achieves performance on par with pooled normalization without compromising data locality. However, sharing normalization parameters such as the mean introduces potential privacy risks, which we further mitigate through a robust privacy-preserving solution. Our contributions include: (i) We systematically evaluate the impact of various federated and local normalization techniques in heterogeneous FL scenarios, (ii) We propose a novel homomorphically encrypted $k$-th ranked element (and median) calculation tailored for the federated setting, enabling secure and efficient federated normalization, (iii) We propose privacy-preserving implementations of widely used normalization techniques for FL, leveraging multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MHE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u5f02\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u672c\u5730\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c8\u8fdd\u80cc\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u4ea4\u6362\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u539f\u5219\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9762\u5411\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u533a\u3001\u90ae\u653f\u7f16\u7801\u533a\u7b49\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5f53\u5730\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u9632\u6216\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04\uff08RepSC-SOM\uff09\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edfSOM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7406\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u533a\u57df\u589e\u957f\u7ec6\u5316\uff0cAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u6770\u514b\u900a\u7ef4\u5c14\u6d2a\u6c34\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u533a\u57df\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling. Our findings suggest that LLM-based approaches are viable for static vulnerability detection in smart contracts, provided domain-specific data and categorization are integrated into training pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u975eEVM\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5e73\u53f0\uff08Solana\u548cAlgorand\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2dOWASP\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8EVM\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975eEVM\u5e73\u53f0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eRust\uff08Solana\uff09\u548cPyTeal\uff08Algorand\uff09\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7247\u6bb5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8f83\u8d2b\u4e4f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982TEAL\uff09\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86Solana\u548cAlgorand\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u9759\u6001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Alexander"], "title": "LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8111\u533a\u4ea4\u4e92\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ec5\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u57fa\u8d28\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u671f\u8fdb\u5c55\u671f\u95f4\u3002\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8111\u533a\u4ea4\u4e92\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684tau-PET\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems.

However, training such models requires substantial computational resources, large curated datasets, and sophisticated alignment procedures. As a result, they constitute highly valuable intellectual property (IP) assets that warrant robust protection mechanisms. Existing IP protection approaches suffer from critical limitations. Model fingerprinting techniques can identify model architectures but fail to establish ownership of specific model instances. In contrast, traditional backdoor-based watermarking methods embed behavioral anomalies that can be easily removed through common post-processing operations such as fine-tuning or knowledge distillation.\n  We propose SEAL, a subspace-anchored watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit signatures directly into the model's latent representational space, supporting both white-box and black-box verification scenarios. Our approach leverages model editing techniques to align the hidden representations of selected anchor samples with predefined orthogonal bit vectors. This alignment embeds the watermark while preserving the model's original factual predictions, rendering the watermark functionally harmless and stealthy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and six prominent LLMs, comparing SEAL with 11 existing fingerprinting and watermarking methods to demonstrate its superior effectiveness, fidelity, efficiency, and robustness. Furthermore, we evaluate SEAL under potential knowledgeable attacks and show that it maintains strong verification performance even when adversaries possess knowledge of the watermarking mechanism and the embedded signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEAL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u7b7e\u540d\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684IP\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u7eb9\u6280\u672f\u53ea\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u8ba4\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u95e8\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b49\u540e\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9009\u5b9a\u951a\u70b9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6bd4\u7279\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSEAL\u76f8\u6bd411\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u77e5\u6653\u6c34\u5370\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAL\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u65e0\u5bb3\u3001\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts.

However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eWi-Fi\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f(CSI)\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u96c6\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "Wi-Fi CSI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u6001\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u591a\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f53\u7cfb\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6(SoK)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7684FAR/FRR/EER\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6bcf\u7528\u6237\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5f88\u5c11\u8003\u8651\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u96c6\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dCSI\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Wi-Fi CSI\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9002\u7528\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Gent", "Christopher Jefferson"], "title": "Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures", "comment": null, "summary": "In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Essence\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4(Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025)\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Using this model, we prove forward secrecy, identify a known clone-attack against post-compromise security and discover functional gaps between WhatsApp's implementation and its specification. We further introduce a methodology to analyze cryptographic protocol implementations for their resilience to side-channel attacks. This is achieved by extending the CryptoBap framework to integrate hardware leakage contracts into the protocol model, which we then pass to the state-of-the-art protocol prover, DeepSec. This enables a detailed security analysis against both functional bugs and microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Using this methodology, we identify a privacy attack in WhatsApp that allows a side-channel attacker to learn the victim's contacts and confirm a known unlinkability attack on the BAC protocol used in electronic passports.\n  Key contributions include (1) the first formal model of WhatsApp, extracted from its binary, (2) a framework to integrate side-channel leakage contracts into protocol models for the first time, and (3) revealing critical vulnerabilities invisible to specification-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eceWhatsApp\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9996\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5408\u7ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u7684BAC\u534f\u8bae\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u5e94\u7528WhatsApp\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790(CryptoBap)\u548c\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b(Ghidra)\u63d0\u53d6WhatsApp\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55CryptoBap\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u786c\u4ef6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5408\u7ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DeepSec\u534f\u8bae\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u514b\u9686\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5141\u8bb8\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u83b7\u53d6\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u62a4\u7167BAC\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0d\u53ef\u94fe\u63a5\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks.

Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHetDAPAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u6848DAPAC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "DAPAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u90fd\u662f\u654f\u611f\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u6784DAPAC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06N\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u7684N-D\u4e2a\u975e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ea4\u7ed9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9D\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u6301DAPAC\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u4f46\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u4ece1/2K\u63d0\u9ad8\u52301/(K+1)\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u4e3a(D+1)/(2KD)\u3002", "conclusion": "HetDAPAC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u914d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions.

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology.

While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\"\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\"\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u5411\u8574\u542b\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8ea\u548cb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5171\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u5411\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(a)\u88ab\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8574\u542b\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48C(b)\u4e0d\u88ab\u8574\u542b\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u7684ABox\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u5dee\u5f02\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c5e\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\uff0c\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u826f\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LVLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u7ef4\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\uff09\u5bf9\u884c\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u539f\u5219\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c2\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u76846\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcoAlign\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoAlign\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684LVLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.

Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning.

Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation.

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6216\u51c6\u5219\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u53d6\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c24\u5176\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f-\u884c\u52a8\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b134\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u6807\u6ce8\u573a\u666f\u7684MACHIAVELLI\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u4e3a\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u5851\u9020\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002"}}
