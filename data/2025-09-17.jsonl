We investigate various\nprompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific\nLLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,\nusing both match-based and execution-based metrics.

As High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many\naccelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize\nlegacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance\nportability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos\nporting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully\nautonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains\nlargely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse\nhardware.\n  This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\"\ncollaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize\nFortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline\nmodernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos\ncodes across hardware partitions.

This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos.

However, CTIDH and dCTIDH rely on\ndummy operations in differential addition chains (DACs) and Matryoshka, which\ncan be exploitable by fault-injection attacks. In this work, we present the\nfirst dummy-free implementation of dCTIDH. Our approach combines two recent\nideas: DACsHUND, which enforces equal-length DACs within each batch without\npadding, and a reformulated Matryoshka structure that removes dummy\nmultiplications and validates all intermediate points. Our analysis shows that\nsmall primes such as 3, 5, and 7 severely restrict feasible DACsHUND\nconfigurations, motivating new parameter sets that exclude them. We implement\ndummy-free dCTIDH-2048-194 and dCTIDH-2048-205, achieving group action costs of\nroughly 357,000-362,000 Fp-multiplications, with median evaluation times of\n1.59-1.60 (Gcyc).

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%).

Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform\nDifferential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to\nsubstantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in\nprivacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced\ncontinual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers\nwhat matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential\nPrivacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the\nsemantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for\nprivate entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general\nknowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This\nmodule leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to\nintelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and\nparameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge\ncrucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that\nPeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,\noutperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks\nwhile ensuring robust privacy."}

At its core, xOffense leverages a\nfine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and\ndecision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized\nagents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an\norchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning\non Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to\ngenerate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We\nevaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and\nAI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently\noutperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of\n79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT.\nThese findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when\nembedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior,\ncost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing."}

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our\nmethod can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data,\nchallenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently\nprivacy-preserving.
