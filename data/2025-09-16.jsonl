This paper develops and evaluates AegisShield, a generative AI\nenhanced threat modeling tool that implements STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK to\nautomate threat generation and provide systematic assessments. By integrating\nreal time threat intelligence from the National Vulnerability Database and\nAlienVault Open Threat Exchange, AegisShield produces streamlined and\naccessible threat descriptions. Our assessment of 243 threats from 15 case\nstudies and over 8000 AI generated threats shows that AegisShield reduces\ncomplexity (p less than 0.001), yields outputs semantically aligned with expert\ndeveloped threats (p less than 0.05), and achieves an 85.4 percent success rate\nin mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (p less than 0.001).

In\nthis work, we study the Giraud and Verneuil atomic pattern for kP, implementing\nit using the right-to-left kP algorithm on the NIST EC P-256 curve. We use the\nFLECC library with constant-time operations and execute on the Texas\nInstruments LAUNCHXLF28379D MCU. We measure Electromagnetic (EM) emissions\nduring kP using a Lecroy WavePro 604HD Oscilloscope, a Langer ICS 105\nIntegrated Circuit Scanner, and a Langer MFA-R 0.2-75 Near Field Probe. We\ninvestigate whether the Giraud and Verneuil atomic blocks are distinguishable\nin EM traces.

These results show that, although the\natomic pattern is correctly implemented with dummy operations, resistance to\nSCA can still be affected by additional processes inserted at hardware or\nsoftware level.This means atomicity alone may not fully protect ECC from SCA.\nMore research is needed to investigate the causes of the additional clock cycle\nprocesses and how intermediate operations are addressed in memory registers.\nThis will help to understand the processes that lead to the insertion of these\nadditional clock cycles. This thesis is the first to experimentally implement\nand investigate Giraud and Verneuil's atomic pattern on hardware, and it offers\nuseful results to improve countermeasures against SCA."}

Similar constraints apply in\nsynthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often\ngenomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be\nguided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or\ncarefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by\nshowing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be\nguided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative\nprompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI\nmodel scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and\nthe former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness\nfunctions or domain-specific prompt design.

We demonstrate\nthis attack in a controlled environment and show that it is cost-effective for\nas little as \\$53.28 per month to disrupt the protocol and to effectively bring\ndown the entire Tor network. To mitigate this problem, we consider the popular\npartial synchrony assumption for the Tor directory protocol that ensures that\nthe protocol security is hampered even when the network delays are large and\nunknown. We design a new Tor directory protocol that leverages any standard\npartial-synchronous consensus protocol to solve this problem, while also\nproving its security. We have implemented a prototype in Rust, demonstrating\ncomparable performance to the current protocol while resisting similar attacks."}

Traditional approaches to sensor\nselection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical\ncorrelations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We\naddress this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,\ncontinuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to\nsystematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence\non state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training\nan LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact\nthrough controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible\neffect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate\nthis approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical\ndomains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the\nstructure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added\ncomplexity.

At USENIX 2024, B\\\"aumer et al. presented the Terrapin attack on SSH,\nwhich relies on the attacker injecting optional messages during the key\nexchange. To mitigate this attack, SSH vendors adopted an extension developed\nby OpenSSH called strict key exchange (\"strict KEX\"). With strict KEX, optional\nmessages are forbidden during the handshake, preventing the attack. In\npractice, this should simplify the state machine of an SSH handshake to a\nlinear message flow similar to that of TLS.\n  In this work, we analyze the design, implementation, and security of strict\nKEX in popular SSH servers, using black-box state learning, which can uncover\nthe hidden state machine of an implementation. In practice, it is limited by\nthe number of learned messages and the complexity of the state machine. Thus,\nlearning the complete state machine of SSH is infeasible. Previous research on\nSSH, therefore, excluded optional messages, learning only a partial state\nmachine. However, these messages are a critical part of the Terrapin attack. We\npropose to instead learn the complete state machine of the handshake phase of\nan SSH server, but with strict KEX enabled.\n  We investigate the security of ten SSH implementations supporting strict KEX\nfor up to five key exchange algorithms.

In this paper, we explore synthesis-based methods as a promising\nsolution, whose challenge is to enable familiar persons to recognize subjects.\nTo solve the challenge, we present a key insight: In most photo sharing\nscenarios, familiar persons recognize subjects through identity perception\nrather than meticulous face analysis.

Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can\nonly upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier\nassumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still\nfall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context\nremain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the\ndynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an\nunrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To\nbetter reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model\nwhere the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and\nembedded within a dynamically changing environment.

While gray-box approaches\nleverage selective \"structural knowledge\" (like the module execution graph of\nthe system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a\nsystem's characteristics (we call them \"structural aspects\"), and potential\nmodel improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by\nformally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number\nof modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact\nthe creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We\nintroduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the\ninherent difficulty of performance modeling.

Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by\nthe number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly,\nwe demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased\nmodeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement.

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}
