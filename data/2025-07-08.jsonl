Developers are increasingly adopting these\ntools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and\ndesign. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how\nLLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published\nbetween January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis\nreveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical\nrisks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated\ndevelopment, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,\nstudies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team\ncollaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of\nstudies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two\nSPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer\nproductivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial\nroom for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency\nare the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and\nActivity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and\nmethodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.\nThis review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future\nresearch and practice.

SLMs offer lightweight and\ncost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them\nattractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical\nunderstanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and\nperformance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents\na comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B\nto 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP,\nMercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three\ndimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational\nefficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The\nfindings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive\nresults while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making\nthem viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However,\nachieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models.\nThese models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require\nmuch more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance\nimprovements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption,\nhighlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the\nmultilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in\nlanguages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker\nperformance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these\ndifferences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across\nprogramming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into\nthe design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks."}

To mitigate the problem,\nsubstantial efforts have been devoted to understanding its characteristics and\nrecommending alternative libraries, especially for programming language (PL)\necosystems with a central package hosting platform, such as Python (PyPI).\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, understanding of C/C++ library\nmigrations is still lacking, possibly due to challenges resulting from the\nfragmented and complicated dependency management practices in the C/C++\necosystem. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper analyzes 19,943 C/C++\nprojects that utilize different package management tools and establishes the\nfirst C/C++ library migration dataset. Based on the dataset, we investigate the\nprevalence, domains, target library, and rationale of C/C++ library migrations\nand compare the results with three widely investigated PLs: Python, JavaScript,\nand Java. We find that the overall trend in the number of C/C++ library\nmigrations is similar to Java. Migrations across different package management\ntools are also observed. In C/C++, library migrations mainly occur in GUI,\nBuild, and OS development, but are rare in domains (e.g., Testing and Logging)\nthat dominate library migrations in the three compared PLs. 83.46\\% of C/C++\nsource libraries only have one migration target, suggesting that our library\nmigration dataset could be used directly to recommend migration targets. We\nfind four C/C++-specific migration reasons, such as less compile time and\nunification of dependency management, revealing the unique dependency\nmanagement requirements in C/C++ projects.

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular.

However, enabling\nsuch collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact\nwith host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,\nfine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure\ninteractions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for\nnon-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically\nconfigure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.\nAdditionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.\n  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and\nseamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs\na Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level\nintents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless\ndevice collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for\nauthorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing\nhardware-independent abstractions.\n  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto\nconfiguration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in\nlarge-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation\npipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%\naccuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new\ndevices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of\nup to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms."}

Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8\nmodels maintained ASR below 65\\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to\nINT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR.

We used\nalgorithmic and cryptographic tools in our implementations to further improve\nthe level of security and efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art works. We\nproposed a new approach called Blind Vote, which is an untraceable, secure,\nefficient, secrecy-preserving, and fully on-chain electronic voting protocol\nbased on the well-known concept of Chaum's blind signatures. We illustrate that\nour approach achieves the same security guarantees as previous methods such as\nTornado Vote [1], while consuming significantly less gas.

On the other hand, we propose a new family of\nalgorithms for private, trustless auctions that protect bidder identities and\nbid values while remaining practical for smart contract execution. We ensure\ntrustlessness by running the auction logic in a smart contract, thereby\neliminating reliance on any single trusted party. This approach prevents bid\ntampering, front-running, and collusion by enforcing immutability and\ndecentralized verification of bids.

However, Rust projects\noften have mixed code, i.e., code that also uses unsafe Rust, FFI (Foreign\nFunction Interfaces), and inline assembly for low-level control. The Rust\ncompiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code\nwhich can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose\nCapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine\ncode and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock\nis kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware\nabstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a\nnovel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing\na memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other\ncapabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety\nautomatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such\ninvalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing\ncross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of\nCapsLock on QEMU.

Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been\nproposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods\nusually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy\nfunction, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the\npossible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible\nassignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN\nremains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features\nwith an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with\ninfinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:\n(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call\nassignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment\ngraphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that\ncan learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.\nTo evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal\nassignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space\ndimensionalities.

Two models are typically\nconsidered: the one-pass model, which outputs results only at the end of the\nstream, and the continual observation model, which requires releasing private\nsummaries at every time step. While the one-pass model allows more efficient\nsolutions, continual observation better reflects scenarios where timely and\nongoing insights are critical.\n  In the one-pass setting, sketches have proven to be an effective tool for\ndifferentially private frequency analysis, as they can be privatized by a\nsingle injection of calibrated noise. In contrast, existing methods in the\ncontinual observation model add fresh noise to the entire sketch at every step,\nincurring high computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for\nheavy hitter detection, where current approaches often require querying every\nitem in the universe at each step, resulting in untenable per-update costs for\nlarge domains.\n  To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new differentially private\nsketching technique based on lazy updates, which perturbs and updates only a\nsmall, rotating part of the output sketch at each time step. This significantly\nreduces computational overhead while maintaining strong privacy and utility\nguarantees. In comparison to prior art, for frequency estimation, our method\nimproves the update time by a factor of $O(w)$ for sketches of dimension $d\n\\times w$; for heavy hitter detection, it reduces per-update complexity from\n$\\Omega(|U|)$ to $O(d \\log w)$, where $U$ is the input domain.

As agents and their environments grow\nmore complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but\ncritical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box\ntesting technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable\nagent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training\nflaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse\nenvironmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying\nconfigurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each\ngenerated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By\ncomparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies\nwhether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to\nunsolvable task conditions.

This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1\ngenerated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original\nhuman-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating\ntoolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for\nreinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL\ncode. We open-source our code in anonymous github."}

We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models.

This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading\nstage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by\nexploiting document ingestion.\n  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce\ntwo novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection --\ntargeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit\nimplementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data\nloaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further\nvalidate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box\npipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants --\ndemonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass\nfilters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the\nurgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against\ncovert content manipulations."}
