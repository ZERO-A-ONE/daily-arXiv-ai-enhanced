Yet, the role of LLMs in supporting cognitively demanding\ntasks, like deductive program verification, remains poorly understood. This\npaper investigates how students interact with an LLM when solving formal\nverification exercises in Dafny, a language that supports functional\ncorrectness, by allowing programmers to write formal specifications and\nautomatically verifying that the implementation satisfies the specification. We\nconducted a mixed-methods study with master's students enrolled in a formal\nmethods course. Each participant completed two verification problems, one with\naccess to a custom ChatGPT interface, that logged all interactions, and the\nother without. We identified strategies used by successful students and\nassessed the level of trust students place in LLMs. %\\todo{Our findings show\nthat something here} Our findings show that students perform significantly\nbetter when using ChatGPT; however, performance gains are tied to prompt\nquality. We conclude with practical recommendations for integrating LLMs into\nformal methods courses more effectively, including designing LLM-aware\nchallenges that promote learning rather than substitution."}

This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,\nrevealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse\nto a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms\nachieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's\ndesign-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural\ncomplexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful\nchallenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model\nthat incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional\ndistribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature\nof real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable\ndifficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several\nalgorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas\ncharacterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us\nto rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem\nto converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of\nindependence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:\nAlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared\nto algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our\nframework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering\nrigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these\nmethods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model."}

In this paper, we analyze 686 developer-ChatGPT\nconversations shared within GitHub issue threads to identify characteristics\nthat make these conversations effective for issue resolution. First, we analyze\nthe conversations and their corresponding issues to distinguish helpful from\nunhelpful conversations. We begin by categorizing the types of tasks developers\nseek help with to better understand the scenarios in which ChatGPT is most\neffective. Next, we examine a wide range of conversational, project, and\nissue-related metrics to uncover factors associated with helpful conversations.\nFinally, we identify common deficiencies in unhelpful ChatGPT responses to\nhighlight areas that could inform the design of more effective developer-facing\ntools. We found that only 62% of the ChatGPT conversations were helpful for\nsuccessful issue resolution. ChatGPT is most effective for code generation and\ntools/libraries/APIs recommendations, but struggles with code explanations.\nHelpful conversations tend to be shorter, more readable, and exhibit stronger\nsemantic and linguistic alignment.

At the issue level, ChatGPT\nperforms best on simpler problems with limited developer activity and faster\nresolution, typically well-scoped tasks like compilation errors.

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process."}
