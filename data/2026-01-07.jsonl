Although code review serves as a critical defense mechanism against security flaws, relevant feedback remains scarce due to limited attention to security issues or a lack of expertise among reviewers. Existing datasets and studies primarily focus on general-purpose code review comments, either lacking security-specific annotations or being too limited in scale to support large-scale research. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{SeRe}, a \\textbf{security-related code review dataset}, constructed using an active learning-based ensemble classification approach. The proposed approach iteratively refines model predictions through human annotations, achieving high precision while maintaining reasonable recall. Using the fine-tuned ensemble classifier, we extracted 6,732 security-related reviews from 373,824 raw review instances, ensuring representativeness across multiple programming languages. Statistical analysis indicates that SeRe generally \\textbf{aligns with real-world security-related review distribution}. To assess both the utility of SeRe and the effectiveness of existing code review comment generation approaches, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches on security-related feedback generation. By releasing SeRe along with our benchmark results, we aim to advance research in automated security-focused code review and contribute to the development of more effective secure software engineering practices."}

At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions.

However, at the National University of the Altiplano of Puno (UNAP), the use of a QR code access system on the institutional Wi-Fi network has generated vulnerabilities related to the lack of individual authentication, user traceability, and access control. Given this situation, this study aims to strengthen the security of the university's wireless network through the application of data analytics, employing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive approaches to the logs generated by the wireless controller (WLC). The methodology consisted of collecting and processing connection data from users, devices, and daily traffic, analyzing behavioral patterns, and detecting anomalies based on statistical models and machine learning algorithms. The results revealed critical usage peaks between 10:00 and 14:00, as well as anomalous behavior associated with recurring devices and irregular traffic spikes.

Existing automated untangling methods, particularly state-of-the-art graph clustering-based approaches, are fundamentally limited by two issues. (1) They over-rely on structural information, failing to grasp the crucial semantic intent behind changes, and (2) they operate as ``single-pass'' algorithms, lacking a mechanism for the critical reflection and refinement inherent in human review processes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Atomizer, a novel collaborative multi-agent framework for composite commit untangling. To address the semantic deficit, Atomizer employs an Intent-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (IO-CoT) strategy, which prompts large language models (LLMs) to infer the intent of each code change according to both the structure and the semantic information of code. To overcome the limitations of ``single-pass'' grouping, we employ two agents to establish a grouper-reviewer collaborative refinement loop, which mirrors human review practices by iteratively refining groupings until all changes in a cluster share the same underlying semantic intent. Extensive experiments on two benchmark C# and Java datasets demonstrate that Atomizer significantly outperforms several representative baselines. On average, it surpasses the state-of-the-art graph-based methods by over 6.0% on the C# dataset and 5.5% on the Java dataset. This superiority is particularly pronounced on complex commits, where Atomizer's performance advantage widens to over 16%."}

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings.

Improper or missing exception handling often leads to severe consequences, including system crashes and resource leaks. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, they struggle with exception handling at the repository level, due to complex dependencies and contextual constraints. In this work, we propose CatchAll, a novel LLM-based approach for repository-aware exception handling. CatchAll equips LLMs with three complementary layers of exception-handling knowledge: (1) API-level exception knowledge, obtained from an empirically constructed API-exception mapping that characterizes the exception-throwing behaviors of APIs in real-world codebases; (2) repository-level execution context, which captures exception propagation by modeling contextual call traces around the target code; and (3) cross-repository handling knowledge, distilled from reusable exception-handling patterns mined from historical code across projects. The knowledge is encoded into structured prompts to guide the LLM in generating accurate and context-aware exception-handling code. To evaluate CatchAll, we construct two new benchmarks for repository-aware exception handling: a large-scale dataset RepoExEval and an executable subset RepoExEval-Exec. Experiments demonstrate that RepoExEval consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a CodeBLEU score of 0.31 (vs. 0.27% for the best baseline), intent prediction accuracy of 60.1% (vs. 48.0%), and Pass@1 of 29% (vs. 25%).

Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging computational intelligence paradigm for SAR image target recognition, enabling cross-site collaboration while preserving local data privacy. However, FL confronts critical security risks, where malicious clients can exploit SAR's multiplicative speckle noise to conceal backdoor triggers, severely challenging the robustness of the computational intelligence model. To address this challenge, we propose NADAFD, a noise-aware and dynamically adaptive federated defense framework that integrates frequency-domain, spatial-domain, and client-behavior analyses to counter SAR-specific backdoor threats. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain collaborative inversion mechanism to expose cross-client spectral inconsistencies indicative of hidden backdoor triggers. We further design a noise-aware adversarial training strategy that embeds $Γ$-distributed speckle characteristics into mask-guided adversarial sample generation to enhance robustness against both backdoor attacks and SAR speckle noise. In addition, we present a dynamic health assessment module that tracks client update behaviors across training rounds and adaptively adjusts aggregation weights to mitigate evolving malicious contributions. Experiments on MSTAR and OpenSARShip datasets demonstrate that NADAFD achieves higher accuracy on clean test samples and a lower backdoor attack success rate on triggered inputs than existing federated backdoor defenses for SAR target recognition."}

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs."}

In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines."}

We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences."}

In group review requests, available on platforms like Phabricator, GitHub, and Bitbucket, a code change is assigned to a reviewer group, allowing any member to review it, unlike individual review assignments to specific reviewers. Drawing parallels with shared task queues in Management Sciences, this study examines the effects of group versus individual review requests on velocity and quality. We investigate approximately 66,000 revisions in the Mozilla Firefox project, combining statistical modeling with practitioner views from a focus group discussion.

This evolution has brought GPU security and reliability to the forefront of concerns. Prior research has shown that CUDA's lack of memory safety can lead to serious vulnerabilities. While fuzzing is effective for finding such bugs on CPUs, equivalent tools for GPUs are lacking due to architectural differences and lack of built-in error detection. In this paper, we propose CuFuzz, a novel compiler-runtime co-design solution to extend state-of-the-art CPU fuzzing tools to GPU programs. CuFuzz transforms GPU programs into CPU programs using compiler IR-level transformations to enable effective fuzz testing. To the best of our knowledge, CuFuzz is the first mechanism to bring fuzzing support to CUDA, addressing a critical gap in GPU security research. By leveraging CPU memory error detectors such as Address Sanitizer, CuFuzz aims to uncover memory safety bugs and related correctness vulnerabilities in CUDA code, enhancing the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated applications. To ensure high fuzzing throughput, we introduce two compiler-runtime co-optimizations tailored for GPU code: Partial Representative Execution (PREX) and Access-Index Preserving Pruning (AXIPrune), achieving average throughput improvements of 32x with PREX and an additional 33% gain with AXIPrune on top of PREX-optimized code. Together, these optimizations can yield up to a 224.31x speedup. In our fuzzing campaigns, CuFuzz uncovered 122 security vulnerabilities in widely used benchmarks."}

Traditional federated learning approaches for IoT security suffer from two critical vulnerabilities: susceptibility to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants poison model updates, and inadequacy against future quantum computing threats that can compromise cryptographic aggregation protocols. This paper presents a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework integrated with post-quantum secure aggregation specifically designed for real-time threat intelligence sharing across critical IoT infrastructure. The proposed framework combines a adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism with lattice-based cryptographic protocols to simultaneously defend against model poisoning attacks and quantum adversaries. We introduce a reputation-based client selection algorithm that dynamically identifies and excludes Byzantine participants while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The secure aggregation protocol employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and homomorphic encryption to ensure confidentiality during parameter updates. Experimental evaluation on industrial IoT intrusion detection datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves 96.8% threat detection accuracy while successfully mitigating up to 40% Byzantine attackers, with only 18% computational overhead compared to non-secure federated approaches. The framework maintains sub-second aggregation latency suitable for real-time applications and provides 256-bit post-quantum security level."}

Yu"], "title": "Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment."}

High-assurance techniques such as X-ray and destructive reverse engineering are accurate but slow and expensive, hindering comprehensive detection for hardware Trojans or firmware tampering. Consequently, there has been increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to automate forensic examination, enabling rapid, large-scale inspection of components without manual oversight. We introduce a non-destructive screening method that uses power side-channel measurements and generative modeling to detect tampering in commodity microcontrollers without trusted hardware. As a proof-of-concept, differential power analysis (DPA) traces are collected from the ChipWhisperer and a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained only on benign measurements to learn nominal power behavior. The trained discriminator then serves as a one-class anomaly detector. We report detection performance on multiple tampering scenarios and discuss how this technique can serve as an intermediate screening tier between basic functional tests and high-cost forensic analysis. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of semiconductor supply chain practice and policy to assess its suitability as an intermediate assurance mechanism."}

We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next.

To address these risks, governments and industry stakeholders are turning toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC), a class of algorithms designed to resist adversaries equipped with quantum computing capabilities. However, existing studies provide limited insight into the implementation-focused aspects of PQC in the ITS domain. This review fills that gap by evaluating the readiness of vehicular communication and security standards for PQC adoption. It examines in-vehicle networks and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) interfaces, while also investigating vulnerabilities at the physical layer, primarily exposure to side-channel and fault injection attacks. The review identifies thirteen research gaps reflecting non-PQC-ready standards, constraints in embedded implementation and hybrid cryptography, interoperability and certificate-management barriers, lack of real-world PQC deployment data in ITS, and physical-attack vulnerabilities in PQC-enabled vehicular communication. Future research directions include updating vehicular communication and security standards, optimizing PQC for low-power devices, enhancing interoperability and certificate-management frameworks for PQC integration, conducting real-world evaluations of PQC-enabled communication and control functions across ITS deployments, and strengthening defenses against AI-assisted physical attacks. A phased roadmap is presented, aligning PQC deployment with regulatory, performance, and safety requirements, thereby guiding the secure evolution of ITS in the quantum computing era."}

To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not. We expect to identify measurable differences in development activity, community engagement, and code complexity between OSS projects that adopt AI libraries and those that do not, offering evidence-based insights into how AI integration reshapes software development practices."}

This study presents the Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS), an innovative IDS that employs the Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) for Feature Selection (FS). Additionally, it introduces a novel technique for enhancing the cybersecurity of cloud computing through the integration of machine learning methodologies with the EVO Algorithm. The Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) effectively diminished features in the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset from 88 to 38 and in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data from 80 to 43, significantly enhancing computing efficiency. HyIDS incorporates four Machine Learning (ML) models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (D_Tree), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The proposed HyIDS was assessed utilizing two real-world intrusion datasets, CIC-DDoS2019 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, both distinguished by considerable class imbalances. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset has a significant imbalance between DDoS assault samples and legal traffic, while the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset primarily comprises benign traffic with insufficient representation of attack types, complicating the detection of minority attacks. A downsampling technique was employed to balance the datasets, hence improving detection efficacy for both benign and malicious traffic. Twenty-four trials were done, revealing substantial enhancements in categorization accuracy, precision, and recall. Our suggested D_TreeEVO model attained an accuracy rate of 99.13% and an F1 score of 98.94% on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, and an accuracy rate of 99.78% and an F1 score of 99.70% on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data. These data demonstrate that EVO significantly improves cybersecurity in Cloud Computing (CC)."}

However, what constitutes a \"defect\" is inherently context-dependent and varies across projects, domains, and stakeholder interpretations. In this paper, we propose a Human-LLM Collaboration (HLC) approach that treats defect prediction as an adaptive process rather than a static classification task. HLC leverages LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning in a feedback loop: users validate predictions alongside their explanations, and these validated examples adaptively guide future predictions through few-shot learning. We evaluate this approach using the weak word smell on the QuRE benchmark of 1,266 annotated Mercedes-Benz requirements. Our results show that HLC effectively adapts to the provision of validated examples, with rapid performance gains from as few as 20 validated examples. Incorporating validated explanations, not just labels, enables HLC to substantially outperform both standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuned BERT models while maintaining high recall. These results highlight how the in-context and Chain-of-Thought learning capabilities of LLMs enable adaptive classification approaches that move beyond one-size-fits-all models, creating opportunities for tools that learn continuously from stakeholder feedback."}

We evaluate three approaches: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), each integrated with a preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection and class balancing. The UNSW NB-15 dataset is used as the primary benchmark, focusing on Tor traffic as anomalies. We analyze statistical similarity between real and synthetic data, and assess classifier performance using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Results show that VAE-generated data provides the best balance between privacy and performance, while GANs offer higher fidelity but risk overfitting. SMOTE, though simple, enhances recall but may lack diversity. The findings demonstrate that GAI methods can significantly improve encrypted traffic detection when trained with privacy-preserving synthetic data."}

We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single language model generates and evaluates counterfactual critiques of its own reasoning. The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone."}

To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase empirical study. First, we analyzed nearly 300 papers published at the top-3 SE conferences since 2022 to assess how prompt design, testing, and optimization are currently reported. Second, we surveyed 105 program committee members from these conferences to capture their expectations for prompt reporting in LLM-driven research.

Our results reveal significant misalignment between current practices and reviewer expectations, particularly regarding version disclosure, prompt justification, and threats to validity. We present our guideline as a step toward improving transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor in LLM-based SE research."}

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models."}

While artifact sharing is now a standard practice and even expected at premier SE venues such as ICSE, the practical usability of these replication packages remains underexplored.

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings. Our findings reveal that only 40\\% of the 100 evaluated artifacts were executable, of which 32.5\\% (13 out of 40) ran without any modification. Regarding effort levels, 17.5\\% (7 out of 40) required low effort, while 82.5\\% (33 out of 40) required moderate to high effort to execute successfully. We identified five common types of modifications and 13 challenges leading to execution failure, spanning environmental, documentation, and structural issues. Among the executable artifacts, only 35\\% (14 out of 40) reproduced the original results. These findings highlight a notable gap between artifact availability, executability, and reproducibility.

We present Arca, a lightweight confidential container framework based on a TEE-in-Container architecture that isolates each workload in an independent, hardware-enforced trust domain while keeping orchestration logic outside the TEE. This design minimizes inter-layer dependencies, confines compromise to per-container boundaries, and restores the TEE's minimal trust principle. We implemented Arca on Intel SGX, Intel TDX, and AMD SEV. Experimental results show that Arca achieves near-native performance and outperforms CoCo in most benchmarks, while the reduced TCB significantly improves verifiability and resilience against host-level compromise. Arca emonstrates that efficient container management and strong runtime confidentiality can be achieved without sacrificing security assurance."}

We present MCP-SandboxScan, a lightweight framework motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that safely executes untrusted tools inside a WebAssembly/WASI sandbox and produces auditable reports of external-to-sink exposures. Our prototype (i) extracts LLM-relevant sinks from runtime outputs (prompt/messages and structured tool-return fields), (ii) instantiates external-input candidates from environment values, mounted file contents, and output-surfaced HTTP fetch intents, and (iii) links sources to sinks via snippet-based substring matching. Case studies on three representative tools show that MCP-SandboxScan can surface provenance evidence when external inputs appear in prompt/messages or tool-return payloads, and can expose filesystem capability violations as runtime evidence. We further compare against a lightweight static string-signature baseline and use a micro-benchmark to characterize false negatives under transformations and false positives from short-token collisions."}

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations."}

This paper bridges this research gap by operationalizing regulatory compliance as a quantitative and dynamic trust metric through our novel automated compliance engine (ACE). ACE first formalizes legal and organizational policies into a verifiable, obligation-centric logic. It then continuously audits system event logs against this logic to detect violations. The core of our contribution is a quantitative model that assesses the severity of each violation along multiple dimensions, including its Volume, Duration, Breadth, and Criticality, to compute a fine-grained, evolving compliance score.

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time.

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems."}

In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk."}

In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines.

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation.

IoT firmware frequently relies on outdated, third-party libraries embedded within monolithic binary blobs, making vulnerability management difficult. While Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standards have matured, generating actionable intelligence from raw firmware dumps remains a manual and error-prone process. This paper presents a lightweight, automated pipeline designed to extract file systems from Linux-based IoT firmware, generate a comprehensive SBOM, map identified components to known vulnerabilities, and apply a multi-factor triage scoring model. The proposed system focuses on risk prioritization by integrating signals from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), and the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Unlike conventional scanners that produce high volumes of uncontextualized alerts, this approach emphasizes triage by calculating a localized risk score for each finding. We describe the architecture, the normalization challenges of embedded Linux, and a scoring methodology intended to reduce alert fatigue. The study outlines a planned evaluation strategy to validate the extraction success rate and triage efficacy using a dataset of public vendor firmware, offering a reproducibility framework for future research in firmware security."}

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25° resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models."}

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

We present MCP-SandboxScan, a lightweight framework motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that safely executes untrusted tools inside a WebAssembly/WASI sandbox and produces auditable reports of external-to-sink exposures. Our prototype (i) extracts LLM-relevant sinks from runtime outputs (prompt/messages and structured tool-return fields), (ii) instantiates external-input candidates from environment values, mounted file contents, and output-surfaced HTTP fetch intents, and (iii) links sources to sinks via snippet-based substring matching.

In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\\% in multi-turn scenarios.

At its core, OpenRT architects a paradigm shift in automated red-teaming by introducing an adversarial kernel that enables modular separation across five critical dimensions: model integration, dataset management, attack strategies, judging methods, and evaluation metrics. By standardizing attack interfaces, it decouples adversarial logic from a high-throughput asynchronous runtime, enabling systematic scaling across diverse models.

Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data.

A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0.46), while succeeding on linguistic attacks like social engineering (AUC 0.78). We introduce structural tokenization, encoding execution-flow patterns (tool calls, arguments, observations) rather than conversational content. This simple representational change dramatically improves cross-attack generalization: +46 AUC points on tool hijacking, +39 points on data exfiltration, and +71 points on unknown attacks, while simultaneously improving in-distribution performance (+6 points). For attacks requiring linguistic features, we propose gated multi-view fusion that adaptively combines both representations, achieving AUC 0.89 on social engineering without sacrificing structural attack detection.

The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points).

Existing differential privacy (DP) solutions for FL often inject noise uniformly across the entire model, degrading utility while providing suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. To address this, we propose LaDP, a novel layer-wise adaptive noise injection mechanism for FL that optimizes privacy protection while preserving model accuracy. LaDP leverages two key insights: (1) neural network layers contribute unevenly to model utility, and (2) layer-wise privacy leakage can be quantified via KL divergence between local and global model distributions. LaDP dynamically injects noise into selected layers based on their privacy sensitivity and importance to model performance.\n  We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that LaDP satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP guarantees and converges under bounded noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 datasets demonstrate that LaDP reduces noise injection by 46.14% on average compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving accuracy by 102.99%. Under the same privacy budget, LaDP outperforms SOTA solutions like Dynamic Privacy Allocation LDP and AdapLDP by 25.18% and 6.1% in accuracy, respectively. Additionally, LaDP robustly defends against reconstruction attacks, increasing the FID of the reconstructed private data by $>$12.84% compared to all baselines.

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs"}

The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vectors through classical preprocessing and normalization. Classical models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels, are evaluated on the full dataset to establish baseline performance under large-sample conditions. Simultaneously, a quantum-enhanced pipeline maps classical features into variational quantum circuits via angle encoding and entangling layers, executed on a CPU-based quantum simulator, with resulting quantum embeddings classified using a classical SVM. Experiments show that while classical models achieve higher overall accuracy with large datasets, quantum-enhanced representations demonstrate superior attack recall and improved class separability when data is scarce, suggesting that quantum feature spaces capture complex correlations inaccessible to shallow classical models. These results highlight the potential of quantum embeddings to improve generalization and representation quality in cybersecurity tasks and provide a reproducible framework for evaluating quantum advantages as quantum hardware and simulators continue to advance."}

In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from \"LLM-as-Text-Generator\" to \"LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.\" We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\\% in multi-turn scenarios.

Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express."}

In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.\n  We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate.

Decision-theoretic alignment under uncertainty", "summary": "This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.\n  MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models."}

This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression.

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory."}

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation."}

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity."}

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development."}

The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains."}

This study investigates emoji-based jailbreaking, where emoji sequences are embedded in textual prompts to trigger harmful and unethical outputs from LLMs. We evaluated 50 emoji-based prompts on four open-source LLMs: Mistral 7B, Qwen 2 7B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 3 8B. Metrics included jailbreak success rate, safety alignment adherence, and latency, with responses categorized as successful, partial and failed. Results revealed model-specific vulnerabilities: Gemma 2 9B and Mistral 7B exhibited 10 % success rates, while Qwen 2 7B achieved full alignment (0% success). A chi-square test (chi^2 = 32.94, p < 0.001) confirmed significant inter-model differences.

Despite the advances of LLM-powered code review comment generation approaches, several practical challenges remain for designing enterprise-grade code review automation tools. In particular, this paper aims at answering the practical question: how can we design a review-guided, context-aware, quality-checked code review comment generation without fine-tuning?\n  In this paper, we present RovoDev Code Reviewer, an enterprise-grade LLM-based code review automation tool designed and deployed at scale within Atlassian's development ecosystem with seamless integration into Atlassian's Bitbucket. Through the offline, online, user feedback evaluations over a one-year period, we conclude that RovoDev Code Reviewer is (1) effective in generating code review comments that could lead to code resolution for 38.70% (i.e., comments that triggered code changes in the subsequent commits); and (2) offers the promise of accelerating feedback cycles (i.e., decreasing the PR cycle time by 30.8%), alleviating reviewer workload (i.e., reducing the number of human-written comments by 35.6%), and improving overall software quality (i.e., finding errors with actionable suggestions)."}

This study presents the Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS), an innovative IDS that employs the Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) for Feature Selection (FS). Additionally, it introduces a novel technique for enhancing the cybersecurity of cloud computing through the integration of machine learning methodologies with the EVO Algorithm. The Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) effectively diminished features in the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset from 88 to 38 and in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data from 80 to 43, significantly enhancing computing efficiency. HyIDS incorporates four Machine Learning (ML) models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (D_Tree), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The proposed HyIDS was assessed utilizing two real-world intrusion datasets, CIC-DDoS2019 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, both distinguished by considerable class imbalances. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset has a significant imbalance between DDoS assault samples and legal traffic, while the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset primarily comprises benign traffic with insufficient representation of attack types, complicating the detection of minority attacks. A downsampling technique was employed to balance the datasets, hence improving detection efficacy for both benign and malicious traffic. Twenty-four trials were done, revealing substantial enhancements in categorization accuracy, precision, and recall. Our suggested D_TreeEVO model attained an accuracy rate of 99.13% and an F1 score of 98.94% on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, and an accuracy rate of 99.78% and an F1 score of 99.70% on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 data. These data demonstrate that EVO significantly improves cybersecurity in Cloud Computing (CC)."}

We find that different correct solutions to the same task can show very different memory and performance patterns, which can lead to hidden operational risks. We present a framework to measure execution-time memory stability across multiple correct generations. At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions. Instability often increases with higher sampling temperature even when pass@1 improves. We also observe correlations between our stability measures and software engineering indicators such as cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, suggesting links between operational behavior and maintainability. Our results support stability-aware selection among passing candidates in CI/CD to reduce operational risk without sacrificing correctness. Artifacts are available."}

In this work, we consider exfiltration attacks where an adversary attempts to sneak model weights out of a datacenter over a network. While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk."}

Existing code vulnerability detection benchmarks employ binary classification, lacking the CWE-level specificity required for actionable feedback in iterative correction systems. We present ALPHA (Adaptive Learning via Penalty in Hierarchical Assessment), the first function-level Python benchmark that evaluates both LLMs and SAST tools using hierarchically aware, CWE-specific penalties. ALPHA distinguishes between over-generalisation, over-specification, and lateral errors, reflecting practical differences in diagnostic utility. Evaluating seven LLMs and two SAST tools, we find LLMs substantially outperform SAST, though SAST demonstrates higher precision when detections occur. Critically, prediction consistency varies dramatically across models (8.26%-81.87% agreement), with significant implications for feedback-driven systems. We further outline a pathway for future work incorporating ALPHA penalties into supervised fine-tuning, which could provide principled hierarchy-aware vulnerability detection pending empirical validation."}

On MOTIF-Bench, a benchmark built from public frameworks with groundtruth headers, MOTIF improves signature recovery from 15% to 86% compared to baseline static analysis tooling, with consistent gains in tool-use correctness and inference stability.

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs"}

However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment."}

This study creates and tests a Machine Learning Canvas, a practical framework that combines business strategy, software engineering, and data science in order to determine the factors that lead to the success of ML projects. We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next. For instance, strong organizational support results in a clearer strategy (β= 0.432, p < 0.001), which improves work processes (β= 0.428, p < 0.001) and builds better infrastructure (β= 0.547, p < 0.001). Together, these elements determine whether a project succeeds. The surprising finding? Although AI assistants make coding faster, they don't guarantee project success. AI assists with the \"how\" of coding but cannot replace the \"why\" and \"what\" of strategic thinking."}
