### [1] [On LLM-Assisted Generation of Smart Contracts from Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23087)
*Fabian Stiehle,Hans Weytjens,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）从业务流程描述生成智能合约代码的可行性，并提出了一个自动化评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的代码生成方法存在局限性，LLM为智能合约生成提供了新思路，但现有研究缺乏对生成代码正确执行的系统评估。

Method: 通过自动化评估框架，测试不同规模和类型的LLM在生成智能合约代码时的表现，重点关注流程执行的关键属性。

Result: LLM在智能合约生成中的表现未能达到完美可靠性，尤其在流程执行、资源分配和数据条件方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 未来研究应探索如何将LLM负责任地集成到现有代码生成工具中，以提高可靠性，本研究框架可作为评估基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

### [2] [FlowETL: An Autonomous Example-Driven Pipeline for Data Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23118)
*Mattia Di Profio,Mingjun Zhong,Yaji Sripada,Marcel Jaspars*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FlowETL是一种基于示例的自主ETL管道架构，旨在自动标准化和准备输入数据集，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ETL解决方案需要大量人工设计特定于上下文的转换，缺乏自动化能力。

Method: FlowETL通过规划引擎和ETL工作器自动构建并应用转换计划，同时提供监控和日志功能。

Result: 在14个不同领域、文件结构和大小的数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlowETL展示了自动化ETL流程的潜力，能够减少人工干预并提高效率。

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

### [3] [Vibe Modeling: Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23120)
*Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合AI和MDE的“vibe modeling”方法，以加速开发可靠复杂系统，并探讨了其机遇与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统需求的增长和复杂性的提升，传统开发方法和工具面临挑战，尤其是模型驱动工程（MDE）的复杂性增加，以及基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的编码方法带来的漏洞和可维护性问题。

Method: 提出“vibe modeling”概念，整合AI和MDE的优势，以自然语言描述生成模型，提升开发效率。

Result: 论文概述了vibe modeling的关键概念，并展示了其在加速开发可靠复杂系统方面的潜力。

Conclusion: vibe modeling为未来建模提供了新的方向，但也面临机遇与挑战。

Abstract: There is a pressing need for better development methods and tools to keep up
with the growing demand and increasing complexity of new software systems. New
types of user interfaces, the need for intelligent components, sustainability
concerns, ... bring new challenges that we need to handle. In the last years,
model-driven engineering (MDE) has been key to improving the quality and
productivity of software development, but models themselves are becoming
increasingly complex to specify and manage. At the same time, we are witnessing
the growing popularity of vibe coding approaches that rely on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to transform natural language descriptions into running code at
the expenses of code vulnerabilities, scalability issues and maintainability
concerns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{vibe modeling} as
a novel approach to integrate the best of both worlds (AI and MDE) to speed up
the development of reliable complex systems. We outline the key concepts of
vibe modeling and highlight the opportunities and open challenges it presents
for the future of modeling.

*Elmira Onagh,Maleknaz Nayebi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GitHub Marketplace中65%的新CI工具功能重复，且通常在六个月内出现。研究通过图模型追踪功能发布和采用，帮助开发者选择最佳发布时机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GitHub Marketplace中CI工具的功能重复现象，为开发者和维护者提供数据支持。

Method: 链接6,983个CI Actions到3,869个提供者，挖掘版本历史，构建图模型追踪功能发布和采用。

Result: 65%的新CI工具功能重复，且一小部分先行工具主导了后续的分支和扩展。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发者提供发布时机和功能定位的指导，并帮助维护者减少冗余工具。

Abstract: GitHub Marketplace is expanding by approximately 41% annually, with new
tools; however, many additions replicate existing functionality. We study this
phenomenon in the platform's largest segment, Continuous Integration (CI), by
linking 6,983 CI Actions to 3,869 providers and mining their version histories.
Our graph model timestamps every functionality's debut, tracks its adoption,
and clusters redundant tools. We find that approximately 65% of new CI Actions
replicate existing capabilities, typically within six months, and that a small
set of first-mover Actions accounts for most subsequent forks and extensions.
These insights enable developers to choose the optimal moment to launch, target
unmet functionality, and help maintainers eliminate redundant tools. We publish
the complete graph and dataset to encourage longitudinal research on innovation
and competition in software ecosystems, and to provide practitioners with a
data-driven roadmap for identifying emerging trends and guiding product
strategy.

### [5] [AutoBridge: Automating Smart Device Integration with Centralized Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23178)
*Siyuan Liu,Zhice Yang,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoBridge自动化生成物联网设备集成代码，通过分阶段调试确保正确性，显著减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少物联网设备集成中的人工编程需求，提升效率和准确性。

Method: 采用分而治之策略，逐步生成设备控制逻辑和平台兼容代码，配备多阶段调试管道。

Result: 在34个设备上测试，平均成功率达93.87%，功能覆盖率达94.87%；用户反馈后可达100%。

Conclusion: AutoBridge在代码准确性和效率上优于人工编程，适合大规模物联网系统集成。

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

### [6] [XABPs: Towards eXplainable Autonomous Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23269)
*Peter Fettke,Fabiana Fournier,Lior Limonad,Andreas Metzger,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出可解释的自主业务流程（XABPs），以解决自主业务流程（ABPs）可能带来的信任、调试、责任、偏见和合规性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABPs虽能提升效率和降低成本，但也带来信任、调试、责任、偏见和合规性等问题，需要可解释性解决方案。

Method: 论文提出系统化方法，包括XABPs的形式化、解释性结构设计，并识别关键BPM研究挑战。

Result: XABPs通过阐明系统逻辑，有望解决ABPs的潜在问题。

Conclusion: XABPs是解决ABPs问题的有效途径，未来研究需关注其形式化和BPM挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

### [7] [SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23348)
*Han Li,Yuling Shi,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Heng Lian,Xin Wang,Yantao Jia,Tao Huang,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate提出了一种基于多代理辩论的框架，通过竞争性讨论提升问题定位的准确性，优于现有独立探索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理框架在独立探索时易陷入局部解，难以识别跨代码库的问题模式，需改进问题定位能力。

Method: SWE-Debate通过代码依赖图生成故障传播路径，组织三轮辩论，由不同视角的代理协作达成共识，最终由MCTS代理生成补丁。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，SWE-Debate表现最优，显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: SWE-Debate通过多代理辩论框架有效提升问题定位和修复能力，为开源代理框架设定了新标杆。

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

### [9] [SWE-Exp: Experience-Driven Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23361)
*Silin Chen,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Yuling Shi,Heng Lian,Longfei Yun,Dong Chen,Weiguo Sun,Lin Cao,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Exp提出了一种基于经验的LLM代理方法，通过积累和复用修复经验，显著提高了软件问题的解决效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在解决软件问题时缺乏记忆能力，无法复用历史经验，导致效率低下。

Method: SWE-Exp通过多层面经验库提取和复用成功与失败的修复经验，实现持续学习。

Result: 实验显示，SWE-Exp在SWE-bench-Verified上达到了41.6%的Pass@1解决率。

Conclusion: SWE-Exp为自动化软件工程代理提供了一种经验驱动的战略方法，显著提升了问题解决效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在探索大型集成空间和仓库级理解方面存在局限性，影响了整体效果。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，Trae Agent平均Pass@1提升10.22%，以75.20%的分数位居榜首。

Conclusion: Trae Agent在软件问题解决中表现出色，已开源以支持研究社区。

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at
https://github.com/bytedance/trae-agent.

### [12] [An Empirical Study on the Amount of Changes Required for Merge Request Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23640)
*Samah Kansab,Mohammed Sayagh,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码审查（CR）中的工作量，基于GitLab合并请求（MRs）的数据集，发现71%的MRs需要调整，28%涉及200行以上代码修改。通过机器学习模型预测CR工作量，AUC达0.84-0.88。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究较少关注基于代码修改量的CR工作量，尤其是在GitLab MRs背景下。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用23,600多个MRs数据集，定义CR工作量为提交后的代码修改量，并训练可解释的机器学习模型。

Result: 71%的MRs需要调整，28%涉及200行以上代码修改；模型AUC为0.84-0.88，复杂度、经验和文本特征是关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 机器学习可有效解释和预测CR工作量，复杂度、经验和历史项目特征是重要影响因素。

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

### [13] [Fine-Grained Privacy Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems via Knowledge Asymmetry Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23229)
*Yufei Chen,Yao Wang,Haibin Zhang,Tao Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黑盒攻击框架，通过知识不对称性在异构知识场景中实现细粒度隐私提取，显著提高了隐私提取率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私攻击方法在RAG系统中存在数据泄漏问题，且难以在多域场景中准确识别知识库来源的句子。

Method: 采用链式思维推理策略，分解对抗查询以最大化信息差异，并通过语义关系评分解决歧义，最终训练神经网络识别隐私信息。

Result: 在单域和多域场景中分别实现了91%和83%的隐私提取率，敏感句子暴露减少了65%。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了RAG系统中攻击与防御的空白，为自适应缓解提供了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, but this advancement introduces
significant privacy risks. Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger
data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived
sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across
multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel
black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and
standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous
knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that
creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content.
Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information
disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and
syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature
scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike
prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative
refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we
achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in
multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in
case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG
systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a
foundation for adaptive mitigation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了针对LLM评估系统的提示注入防御方法，提出了一种名为盲攻击的威胁类型，并通过结合标准评估（SE）和反事实评估（CFE）的框架来检测攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM评估系统容易受到提示注入攻击，尤其是盲攻击，因此需要一种有效的防御机制。

Method: 提出SE+CFE框架，通过重新评估提交内容在标准条件和反事实条件下的表现来检测攻击。

Result: 实验表明，标准评估易受攻击，而SE+CFE框架显著提高了安全性，且性能损失最小。

Conclusion: SE+CFE框架能有效防御盲攻击，为LLM评估系统提供了更安全的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

### [15] [LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611)
*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）分析感染截图以提取IoCs、追踪感染向量和活动的新方法，展示了从1000张截图中提取出337个可操作URL和246个相关文件，并识别出三个恶意活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注主动检测恶意软件，而忽略了利用感染截图等反应性分析手段。手动分析海量窃取日志不切实际，因此需要一种可扩展的方法来增强威胁情报。

Method: 利用LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）分析感染截图，提取IoCs（如恶意URL、安装文件等），并关联文件名、URL和感染主题以追踪活动和感染向量。

Result: 从1000张截图中提取了337个可操作URL和246个相关文件，识别出三个恶意活动，揭示了恶意软件分发方法和社会工程策略。

Conclusion: 通过从传统日志检测转向基于感染截图的反应性分析，该方法为识别感染向量和早期干预提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BIKE密码系统中的格结构，以发现更多弱密钥并提升安全性。

Method: 构建秩2格并分析其性质，推广弱密钥恢复方法，求解最短向量问题并获取格的约化基。

Result: 证明了弱密钥恢复问题隐含最短向量问题，并获得了格的约化基，从而能检测更多弱密钥。

Conclusion: 通过格的约化基，可以更全面地检测弱密钥，提升BIKE密码系统的安全性。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a rank $2$ lattice over a polynomial ring arising
from the public key of the BIKE cryptosystem \cite{aragon2022bike}. The secret
key is a sparse vector in this lattice. We study properties of this lattice and
generalize the recovery of weak keys from \cite{BardetDLO16}. In particular, we
show that they implicitly solved a shortest vector problem in the lattice we
constructed. Rather than finding only a shortest vector, we obtain a reduced
basis of the lattice which makes it possible to check for more weak keys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGC的后验解释性缺乏形式化和一致的评估，影响了研究的可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出一个多目标优化框架来统一现有的后验解释性算法，并改进评估协议，使用Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@k等指标。

Result: 通过统一方法和改进评估标准，提高了KGC解释性研究的可重复性和影响力。

Conclusion: 本文为KGC解释性研究提供了统一的方法和评估标准，旨在推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了数据准备原则（DRAI）如何应用于领导级科学数据集以训练基础模型，提出了一个二维准备框架，并分析了四个领域的典型工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决科学数据在AI训练中的预处理挑战，特别是在高性能计算环境中。

Result: 结果是一个成熟度矩阵，用于评估科学数据的准备情况，并指导基础设施开发。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为跨领域、可扩展和可复现的科学AI提供了标准化支持。

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过强化学习以1:4比例混合去偏见和推理样本，能在减少10%偏见的同时保留88%推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力提升与偏见缓解之间的权衡关系。

Method: 比较三种偏见缓解策略（SFT、KD、RL），并通过调整样本比例分析推理与偏见的权衡。

Result: 强化学习在1:4混合比例下表现最佳，减少10%偏见且保留88%推理准确性。

Conclusion: 提供了一种平衡公平性与模型能力的实用方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上表现极差，失败率超过93%。研究通过听觉图灵测试揭示了AI在选择性注意力、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应方面的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 设计了包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，涵盖七类任务，评估了GPT-4和Whisper等先进模型。

Result: AI模型最高准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%，揭示了其在复杂听觉场景中的严重不足。

Conclusion: 研究为衡量AI听觉进步提供了诊断框架，并指出需整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了判断性预测中的论证连贯性，提出并验证了连贯性对提高预测准确性的作用，同时发现用户对此属性认知不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证连贯性在判断性预测中的作用，以提升预测准确性。

Method: 提出论证连贯性的正式定义，并通过人类和LLM预测者评估其影响，同时进行用户实验。

Result: 过滤不连贯预测显著提高准确性，但用户普遍未意识到连贯性的重要性。

Conclusion: 需在基于论证的判断性预测中引入机制过滤不连贯意见，以优化群体预测。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Shapley值的责任度量（WSMS）在ontology-mediated查询回答中的计算复杂性，发现其数据复杂度在可一阶重写的查询类中是多项式时间，但在支持可达性查询的ontology语言中为shP-hard。此外，结合复杂度分析表明，即使无ontology，某些查询类也难解。然而，DL-Lite方言中的特定查询类可高效计算WSMS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中各事实的责任是解释性数据库研究的重要问题。本文旨在探讨基于Shapley值的责任度量在ontology-mediated查询中的计算复杂性，以明确其可处理性边界。

Method: 利用数据库领域的结果，分析WSMS在不同查询类和ontology语言中的计算复杂性，包括数据复杂度和结合复杂度。

Result: WSMS在可一阶重写的查询类中具有多项式数据复杂度，但在支持可达性查询的ontology语言中为shP-hard。某些查询类即使无ontology也难解，而DL-Lite方言中的特定查询类可高效计算。

Conclusion: 本文明确了WSMS计算复杂性的边界，为实际应用提供了理论指导，特别是在DL-Lite方言中的高效计算类。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分（SAS）方法，通过分治法减少复杂实例的处理成本，显著减少了二进制变量的使用，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统的分治法效率不足，需要更优的ReLU变量选择方法。

Method: 提出SAS评分方法，并改进BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局评分（GS）方法。结合Hybrid MILP调用α,β-CROWN和部分MILP。

Result: SAS减少了约6倍的二进制变量，同时保持准确性。Hybrid MILP将未解决实例减少40%，运行时间合理。

Conclusion: SAS和Hybrid MILP结合提供了一种高效准确的验证方法，适用于大规模CNN。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is propelling automated
scientific discovery to the next level, with LLM-based Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Scientist systems now taking the lead in scientific research. Several
influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems,

analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

Result: 提出3级自主AI分类，强调人类监督的必要性。

Conclusion: AI不应完全自主，需人类监督以降低风险。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Result: 新方法在Corr2Cause基准测试中表现显著优于传统方法，性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 先进推理模型结合结构化流程能显著提升因果发现能力，为跨领域应用提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释方法缺乏形式化严谨性，而逻辑解释虽严谨但假设严格，不适用于图像分类器。

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上有不同表现，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式化严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器，且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Result: 实验证明DICE在多个领域有效且通用，无需额外训练成本。

Conclusion: DICE为LLM代理提供了理论支持、通用的示例选择方法，提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAR的个性化问题推荐方法，通过将协作思想融入探索机制，解决了传统强化学习方法在训练中探索效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将个性化问题推荐建模为马尔可夫决策过程并使用强化学习解决，但存在探索效率低的问题，无法在训练中为每个学生找到最佳问题。

Method: 提出Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR)，将协作思想融入探索机制，以在有限的训练轮次内实现更高效的探索。

Result: 实验表明，RAR显著提升了推荐性能，且该框架可应用于任何基于强化学习的问题推荐系统。

Conclusion: RAR通过改进探索机制，有效提升了个性化问题推荐的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in
https://github.com/wuming29/RAR.git.

Result: TextQuests提供了一个评估AI代理在长会话中自主问题解决能力的有效工具。

Conclusion: TextQuests推动了AI代理在复杂探索性环境中长期推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.
