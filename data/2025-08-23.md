### [1] [On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135)
*Sumudu Liyanage,Sherlock A. Licorish,Markus Wagner,Stephen G. MacDonell*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个全面的自动化程序修复(APR)工具评估框架，并以Sorald工具为例进行验证，发现虽然能修复特定规则违规，但会引入新缺陷、降低功能正确性和代码结构质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅评估APR工具清除违规的能力，忽视了其可能引入新违规、改变代码功能和降低代码结构质量的问题，需要开发全面的评估框架。

Method: 以Sorald工具为案例研究，评估其在2,393个Java代码片段中修复3,529个SonarQube违规的效果，分析修复后的代码质量变化。

Result: Sorald修复了特定规则违规，但引入了2,120个新缺陷(32个bug、2,088个代码异味)，单元测试失败率达24%，代码结构质量下降。

Conclusion: 需要采用能捕捉APR工具全方位影响的评估方法，包括副作用评估，以确保其安全有效应用。

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

*Frederik Vandeputte*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出GenAI原生系统设计范式，将生成式AI认知能力与传统软件工程结合，建立可靠、自适应、高效的系统架构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI虽然具有变革性能力，但其不可预测性和低效性给系统开发带来挑战，需要新的设计范式来构建可靠系统

Method: 提出五大核心支柱的设计原则（可靠性、卓越性、可进化性、自依赖性、保障性）和架构模式（GenAI原生单元、有机基板、可编程路由器）

Result: 构建了GenAI原生软件栈的关键要素框架，为创建弹性自进化系统提供指导

Conclusion: 该框架需要进一步验证和实验，旨在激发未来研究并推动相关社区实施和完善这一概念框架

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

### [3] [An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423)
*Ruiqi Wang,Zezhou Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了知识蒸馏在代码理解任务中的有效性，发现特征蒸馏方法效果最佳，学生模型仅用5%参数即可达到教师模型98%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在代码理解中表现出色但计算开销大，知识蒸馏技术在其他领域成功应用但在代码理解领域研究不足

Method: 使用基于logit和基于特征的两种知识蒸馏方法，在8个学生模型和2个教师PLM上进行实验，覆盖3个下游任务

Result: 知识蒸馏相比标准微调能显著提升性能，代码专用PLM作为教师效果更好，特征蒸馏方法表现最优，学生模型仅需5%参数即可保留98%教师性能

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在代码理解任务中非常有效，特征蒸馏方法表现最佳，教师-学生架构相似性并非关键因素，为高效代码理解模型部署提供了重要指导

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

*Dongjun Yu,Xiao Yan,Zhenrui Li,Jipeng Xiao,Haochuan He,Yongda Yu,Hao Zhang,Guoping Rong,Xiaobo Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SynthCoder是一个针对代码补全任务优化的LLM模型，通过AST节点提取、BM25算法和调用图构建多样化数据集，采用课程学习和DPO对齐的两阶段训练，在多个主流代码补全基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码补全模型在优化过程中存在性能波动问题，某些数据集上的性能提升往往伴随着其他数据集上的性能下降，甚至低于基线模型。需要一种能够稳定提升代码补全性能的方法。

Method: 1) 结合AST节点提取和启发式方法构建多样化数据集；2) 使用BM25算法和调用图丰富跨文件上下文信息；3) 以Seed-Coder-8B-Base为基础模型，采用课程学习进行微调；4) 使用拒绝采样生成的偏好对进行DPO对齐训练。

Result: 在aiXcoder、ExecRepoBench、CrossCodeEval和CoLT等主流仓库级代码补全基准测试中表现优异，有效缓解了模型重复现有代码的常见问题。

Conclusion: SynthCoder通过精心设计的数据集构建和两阶段训练策略，成功实现了在代码补全任务上的SOTA性能，解决了现有优化方法的性能波动问题。

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

### [5] [Towards the Assessment of Task-based Chatbots: From the TOFU-R Snapshot to the BRASATO Curated Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15496)
*Elena Masserini,Diego Clerissi,Daniela Micucci,João R. Campos,Leonardo Mariani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个数据集TOFU-R和BRASATO，用于支持任务型聊天机器人的可靠性、安全性和鲁棒性评估研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前任务型聊天机器人的质量评估缺乏大规模高质量数据集，现有方法往往基于有限样本或过时代理，难以有效评估技术效果。

Method: 创建了两个数据集：TOFU-R是从GitHub收集的Rasa聊天机器人快照，代表开源实践；BRASATO是经过筛选的最相关聊天机器人集合，关注对话复杂性、功能复杂性和实用性。

Result: 提供了数据集创建和维护的工具支持，为聊天机器人可靠性研究提供了可复现的基础设施。

Conclusion: 这些数据集填补了任务型聊天机器人评估领域的数据空白，有助于推动该领域的可靠性和安全性研究。

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

### [7] [QUPER-MAn: Benchmark-Guided Target Setting for Maintainability Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15512)
*Markus Borg,Martin Larsson,Philip Breid,Nadim Hagatulah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: QUPER-MAn模型将可维护性从被忽视的开发结果转变为主动管理的目标，通过基准测试和目标设定支持需求工程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可维护性在软件开发中经常被忽视，尽管其重要性已被广泛认可。需求工程可以通过促进讨论和设定适当目标来解决这一差距

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了QUPER-MAn模型（基于QUPER性能需求模型的维护性适配版本），集成了可维护性基准测试并支持目标设定

Result: 研究发现可维护性仍然是次要的质量关注点，明确的需求通常只泛泛提及编码规范，工具虽然常见但仅用于与工程实践相关的隐式需求

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn模型能够通过知情和负责任的工程决策，将可维护性从被忽视的开发结果转变为主动管理的目标

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

### [8] [A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536)
*Yi Zhang,He Jiang,Xiaochen Li,Shikai Guo,Peiyu Zou,Zun Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VERMEI是一种测试FPGA逻辑综合工具的新方法，通过识别僵尸逻辑、等效变异和差异测试来发现工具缺陷，在5个月内发现了15个bug


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA逻辑综合工具中的缺陷可能导致意外行为和安全隐患，现有测试方法存在测试程序语义和逻辑复杂性不足的问题

Method: 包含三个模块：预处理模块通过仿真和覆盖率分析识别种子程序中的僵尸逻辑；等效变异模块通过贝叶斯采样从历史Verilog设计中提取逻辑片段，在僵尸区域修剪或插入逻辑片段生成等效变体；错误识别模块基于差异测试比较种子和变体程序的综合输出来识别bug

Result: 在Yosys、Vivado和Quartus上的实验表明VERMEI优于最先进方法，5个月内向供应商报告了15个bug，其中9个被确认为新bug

Conclusion: VERMEI通过生成具有复杂控制流和结构的测试程序，有效提高了FPGA逻辑综合工具的测试效果，能够发现更多工具缺陷

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 通过动作研究在IT公司建立技术债务管理过程，并分析实践者采用的方法和对TD意识的长期影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术债务管理研究很多但实践采用少，需要在实际IT环境中建立可持续的TDM过程

Method: 采用动作研究方法（16个月内5个行动周期），通过问卷调查、团队会议观察、TD-SAGAT意识测量和背式数据评估来分析TD意识

Result: 实践者偏好优先还清低合成本的TD，背式项目中的提醒机制可以持续提高TD意识

Conclusion: 工作坊基础的TDM方法可行且能引起可持续的过程改变，推出了新的TDM思路如重提交日期、"TD讨论过"复选框等

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

### [11] [MCPTox: A Benchmark for Tool Poisoning Attack on Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14925)
*Zhiqiang Wang,Yichao Gao,Yanting Wang,Suyuan Liu,Haifeng Sun,Haoran Cheng,Guanquan Shi,Haohua Du,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCPTox基准测试首次系统评估LLM智能体在MCP协议下的工具投毒攻击脆弱性，发现主流模型普遍易受攻击，攻击成功率高达72.8%，现有安全对齐机制对此类攻击几乎无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)为LLM智能体提供标准化外部工具接口，但引入了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注工具输出注入攻击，而工具元数据中的恶意指令投毒攻击缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具构建MCPTox基准，设计3种攻击模板通过few-shot学习生成1312个恶意测试用例，覆盖10类潜在风险，评估20个主流LLM智能体。

Result: 发现智能体普遍脆弱，o1-mini攻击成功率72.8%；能力越强的模型越易受攻击；现有安全对齐几乎无效，最高拒绝率(Claude-3.7-Sonnet)不到3%。

Conclusion: 工具投毒是广泛存在的威胁，现有安全机制无法有效防御利用合法工具进行未授权操作的恶意行为，MCPTox为理解和缓解此威胁提供了重要实证基础。

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated
with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

TL;DR: MoEcho揭示了混合专家(MoE)架构中的侧信道安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过硬件执行痕迹推断敏感用户数据，提出了四种新型侧信道攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构通过动态路由实现计算效率，但输入依赖的激活模式在硬件层面留下了可被利用的时空痕迹，形成了新的隐私攻击面。

Method: 提出了四种新型架构侧信道：CPU上的缓存占用通道和页出重加载，GPU上的性能计数器和TLB驱逐重加载，并基于这些漏洞开发了四种隐私攻击方法。

Result: 成功在基于MoE的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型上实现了提示推断、响应重建、视觉推断和视觉重建攻击，证明了严重的安全威胁。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对现代Transformer中流行MoE结构的运行时架构级安全分析，揭示了严重的安全隐私威胁，呼吁在开发高效大规模AI服务时采取及时有效的防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

Result: 识别出当前漏洞检测机器学习方法在数据集透明度（如漏洞类型样本数量统计）和训练数据适用性（使用语义相似函数而非真实漏洞程序）方面的重要缺陷，以及模型选择和训练粒度对效果的影响。

Conclusion: 机器学习在漏洞检测领域的应用需要更加严谨的数据集评估标准和模型选择策略，作者之前的研究经验可以为该领域的未来发展提供有价值的参考和指导。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated impressive results in
various fields, including software vulnerability detection. Nonetheless, using
machine learning to identify software vulnerabilities presents new challenges,
especially regarding the scale of data involved, which was not a factor in
traditional methods. Consequently, in spite of the rise of new
machine-learning-based approaches in that space, important shortcomings persist
regarding their evaluation. First, researchers often fail to provide concrete
statistics about their training datasets, such as the number of samples for
each type of vulnerability. Moreover, many methods rely on training with
semantically similar functions rather than directly on vulnerable programs.
This leads to uncertainty about the suitability of the datasets currently used
for training. Secondly, the choice of a model and the level of granularity at
which models are trained also affect the effectiveness of such vulnerability
discovery approaches.
  In this paper, we explore the challenges of applying machine learning to
vulnerability discovery. We also share insights from our two previous research
papers, Bin2vec and BinHunter, which could enhance future research in this
field.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetSight是一个用于网络数据异常检测的监督学习框架，能够在线持续检测和适应数据分布变化，无需人工干预，通过伪标签技术和知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘，在三个长期网络数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习异常检测系统在面对数据分布变化时的适应性问题。现有的监督学习方法需要昂贵的人工标注，而无监督方法需要干净的训练数据，这两种要求在现实中都难以满足。

Method: 提出NetSight框架，采用新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，使用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略来防止灾难性遗忘，实现在线持续检测和适应分布变化。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上的评估显示，NetSight相比依赖人工标注的最先进方法具有更优的适应性能，F1分数提升最高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight证明了其在经历分布变化的动态网络中的鲁棒性和有效性，为解决分布变化下的异常检测问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

### [17] [Conditional Cube Attack on Round-Reduced ASCON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15172)
*Zheng Li,Xiaoyang Dong,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文评估了认证加密算法Ascon对抗cube-like方法的安全性，提出了针对5/6轮缩减Ascon的新cube攻击，并将理论攻击转化为实际攻击，同时首次实现了对7轮Ascon的密钥恢复攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ascon是CAESAR竞赛第三轮的16个幸存算法之一，其非线性层更复杂且状态更小，使得攻击者难以选择足够的cube变量。此前对Keccak密钥模式可攻击至少7轮，而对Ascon的最佳密钥恢复攻击仅到6轮。

Method: 推广条件cube攻击方法，引入cube-like密钥子集技术，根据不同的密钥条件将完整密钥空间划分为多个子集，对每个子集使用cube测试器来确定密钥是否属于该子集。

Result: 将6轮攻击的时间复杂度从2^66降低到2^40，实现了首个7轮密钥恢复攻击，总时间复杂度约为2^103.9。对于大小为2^117的弱密钥子集，攻击成本仅为2^77。

Conclusion: 这些攻击不会威胁完整12轮Ascon的安全性，但展示了cube-like方法在分析缩减轮次Ascon时的有效性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the secure level of authenticated encryption
\textsc{Ascon} against cube-like method. \textsc{Ascon} submitted by Dobraunig
\emph{et~al.} is one of 16 survivors of the 3rd round CAESAR competition. The
cube-like method is first used by Dinur \emph{et~al.} to analyze Keccak keyed
modes. At CT-RSA 2015, Dobraunig \emph{et~al.} applied this method to 5/6-round
reduced \textsc{Ascon}, whose structure is similar to Keccak keyed modes.
However, for \textsc{Ascon} the non-linear layer is more complex and state is
much smaller, which make it hard for the attackers to select enough cube
variables that do not multiply with each other after the first round. This
seems to be the reason why the best previous key-recovery attack is on 6-round
\textsc{Ascon}, while for Keccak keyed modes (Keccak-MAC and Keyak) the
attacked round is no less than 7-round.
  In this paper, we generalize the conditional cube attack proposed by Huang
\emph{et~al.}, and find new cubes depending on some key bit conditions for
5/6-round reduced \textsc{Ascon}, and translate the previous theoretic 6-round
attack with $2^{66}$ time complexity to a practical one with $2^{40}$ time
complexity. Moreover, we propose the first 7-round key-recovery attack on
\textsc{Ascon}. By introducing \emph{the cube-like key-subset technique}, we
divide the full key space into many subsets according to different key
conditions. For each key subset, we launch the cube tester to determine if the
key falls into it. Finally, we recover the full key space by testing all the
key subsets. The total time complexity is about $2^{103.9}$. In addition, for a
weak-key subset, whose size is $2^{117}$, the attack is more efficient and
costs only $2^{77}$ time complexity. Those attacks do not threaten the full
round (12 rounds) \textsc{Ascon}.

*Badih Ghazi,Pritish Kamath,Alexander Knop,Ravi Kumar,Pasin Manurangsi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文扩展了效用优先的差分隐私方法，支持任意私有估计器序列，隐私预算最多翻倍，并能无额外隐私成本进行超参数调优，包括扩展到Renyi差分隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私采用"隐私优先"视角，但实践中用户往往需要"效用优先"——先确定所需效用水平，再计算相应的隐私成本。现有研究主要局限于简单的拉普拉斯或高斯噪声机制。

Method: 扩展Wu等人[2019]和Liu与Talwar[2019]的工作，支持任意私有估计器序列，通过渐进减少相关噪声生成逐渐精确的估计，隐私成本仅归于最不嘈杂的迭代结果。

Result: 实现了对任意估计器序列的支持，隐私预算最多增加一倍；证明了超参数调优（包括最优隐私预算选择）无需额外隐私成本；结果扩展到ex-post Renyi差分隐私。

Conclusion: 本文显著推广了效用优先隐私机制，使其适用于更广泛的估计器类型和隐私定义，为实际应用提供了更灵活的隐私-效用权衡框架。

Abstract: The conventional approach in differential privacy (DP) literature formulates
the privacy-utility trade-off with a "privacy-first" perspective: for a
predetermined level of privacy, a certain utility is achievable. However,
practitioners often operate under a "utility-first" paradigm, prioritizing a
desired level of utility and then determining the corresponding privacy cost.
  Wu et al. [2019] initiated a formal study of this "utility-first" perspective
by introducing ex-post DP. They demonstrated that by adding correlated Laplace
noise and progressively reducing it on demand, a sequence of increasingly
accurate estimates of a private parameter can be generated, with the privacy
cost attributed only to the least noisy iterate released. This led to a Laplace
mechanism variant that achieves a specified utility with minimal privacy loss.
However, their work, and similar findings by Whitehouse et al. [2022], are
primarily limited to simple mechanisms based on Laplace or Gaussian noise.
  In this paper, we significantly generalize these results. In particular, we
extend the work of Wu et al. [2019] and Liu and Talwar [2019] to support any
sequence of private estimators, incurring at most a doubling of the original
privacy budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hyperparameter tuning for
these estimators, including the selection of an optimal privacy budget, can be
performed without additional privacy cost. Finally, we extend our results to
ex-post Renyi DP, further broadening the applicability of utility-first privacy
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出RAGAN攻击框架，利用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力生成高质量虚假用户资料，提升推荐系统的数据投毒攻击效果和隐蔽性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统易受数据投毒攻击，但现有方法生成的虚假文本评论质量较差，影响攻击效果和隐蔽性。需要利用先进模型提升文本质量

Method: 提出RAGAN框架，通过演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略增强上下文学习，使用越狱器生成资料，并通过指令代理和守护器协同优化攻击可迁移性和隐蔽性

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，RAGAN实现了最先进的中毒攻击性能

Conclusion: RAGAN框架能有效生成高质量虚假用户资料，为评估推荐系统鲁棒性提供了有力工具

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

TL;DR: 连接车达的安全风险与用户感知研究：通过标准分析和用户调查，揭示了连接车暴露的网络安全风险和隐私泄漏问题，以及用户对智能汽车的信任度和数据风险意识的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接车技术的快速发展带来智能移动性的同时，也引发了重大的网络安全和隐私风险。这些风险包括远程未授权访问和个人数据泄漏等，需要系统性的风险评估和相关标准规范的分析。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）对16个国际标准和规定进行综合分析，从监管强度、技术特异性、供应链风险处理和个人数据处理等多角度评估；2）进行用户偏向调查，研究消费者对智能汽车的信任度、假拒原因、数据风险意识和信息获取情况。

Result: 研究发现当前标准规范在保护连接车安全方面存在不足，同时用户对智能汽车的信任度和数据风险的认知与实际风险存在差距，用户感知到的信息不足以做出充分的风险判断。

Conclusion: 这项研究通过结合监管分析和用户感知研究，提供了对连接车生态系统面临的挑战和期望的更全面理解，为推动更有效的安全保护措施和用户教育提供了重要依据。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet-connected vehicle technologies has
introduced a new era of smart mobility, while simultaneously raising
significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. This paper explores the
evolving threat landscape associated with connected vehicles, focusing on risks
such as unauthorized remote access and the potential leakage of personal data.
To assess the current state of protection, we conducted a comprehensive
analysis of 16 international standards and regulations, evaluating them from
multiple perspectives including regulatory strength, technical specificity,
treatment of supply chain risks, and approaches to personal data handling.
  In parallel, we carried out a user-focused survey designed to map consumer
attitudes toward smart cars. The survey investigated which types of vehicles
users trust and prefer, the reasons behind rejecting certain car types, their
awareness of data-related risks, and whether they feel adequately informed
about how their vehicles handle data. By combining regulatory analysis with
user perception insights, this study aims to contribute to a more holistic
understanding of the challenges and expectations surrounding connected vehicle
ecosystems.

TL;DR: IPIGuard是一种防御间接提示注入攻击的新方法，通过工具依赖图(TDG)将动作规划与外部数据交互解耦，有效减少恶意工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理防御方法依赖模型自身安全性假设，缺乏对代理行为的结构性约束，容易受到更强攻击向量的绕过。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，将代理任务执行建模为工具依赖图的遍历过程，明确分离动作规划和外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间取得了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard为动态环境中开发更安全的代理系统铺平了道路，显著增强了对抗间接提示注入攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 该研究建立了LLVM前向边控制流完整性(CFI)变体与内存损坏漏洞类别的分类映射，为开发者在现有代码库中逐步部署CFI提供实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存损坏漏洞仍然是软件安全最严重的威胁之一，虽然CFI技术可以缓解这类攻击，但开发者缺乏如何在实际软件中应用CFI的具体指导。

Method: 基于Top 10已知被利用漏洞(KEV)列表，识别四个高影响漏洞类别并为每个类别选择一个代表性CVE，评估LLVM的CFI对这些CVE的防护效果。

Result: CFI在两个案例中成功阻止了漏洞利用，但在另外两个案例中失败，展示了其潜力和当前局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为CFI在生产系统中的明智部署决策提供支持，并为改进CFI的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to
software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code
execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,
developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to
real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's
forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering
actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in
existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one
representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and
explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other
two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support
informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the
practical use of CFI in production systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BadFU攻击，首次展示了在联邦学习遗忘机制中，恶意客户端可以通过看似合法的遗忘请求向全局模型注入后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私和监管合规要求的增长，联邦学习中的机器遗忘机制变得越来越重要。然而，将遗忘机制整合到联邦学习中引入了新的安全风险，特别是攻击者可能利用遗忘过程破坏全局模型的完整性。

Method: 提出BadFU攻击策略：恶意客户端在联邦训练过程中使用后门样本和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，然后请求遗忘伪装样本，使全局模型转变为后门状态。

Result: 在各种联邦学习框架和遗忘策略下的广泛实验验证了BadFU的有效性，揭示了当前联邦遗忘实践中的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦遗忘机制中的严重安全漏洞，强调了开发更安全、更鲁棒的联邦遗忘机制的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Result: 在真实Android市场数据集上，Mars在风险识别方面达到0.838的F1分数，证据检索达到0.934的F1分数。用户研究表明效率比传统手动分析提升60-90%。

Conclusion: Mars系统成功实现了移动应用安全风险的自动化识别，显著提高了分析效率，生成的证据链为后续人工审核和执法决策提供了透明依据。

Abstract: Mobile application marketplaces are responsible for vetting apps to identify
and mitigate security risks. Current vetting processes are labor-intensive,
relying on manual analysis by security professionals aided by semi-automated
tools. To address this inefficiency, we propose Mars, a system that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated risk identification and profiling.
Mars is designed to concurrently analyze multiple applications across diverse
risk categories with minimal human intervention. To enhance analytical
precision and operational efficiency, Mars leverages a pre-constructed risk
identification tree to extract relevant indicators from high-dimensional
application features. This initial step filters the data, reducing the input
volume for the LLM and mitigating the potential for model hallucination induced
by irrelevant features. The extracted indicators are then subjected to LLM
analysis for final risk determination. Furthermore, Mars automatically
generates a comprehensive evidence chain for each assessment, documenting the
analytical process to provide transparent justification. These chains are
designed to facilitate subsequent manual review and to inform enforcement
decisions, such as application delisting. The performance of Mars was evaluated
on a real-world dataset from a partner Android marketplace. The results
demonstrate that Mars attained an F1-score of 0.838 in risk identification and
an F1-score of 0.934 in evidence retrieval. To assess its practical
applicability, a user study involving 20 expert analysts was conducted, which
indicated that Mars yielded a substantial efficiency gain, ranging from 60% to
90%, over conventional manual analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 传统推理模型仅将频谱图方法作为外围组件，需要更数学基础和计算高效的推理系统来整合符号逻辑和神经推理

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理，包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则基础

Conclusion: 图信号处理为稳健和可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础和计算高效的底层架构

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为描述性状态表示和规范性奖励函数两个独立组件，但作者认为这两个方面可能从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现，这一可能性尚未得到计算建模。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别。基于佛教认识论，通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计散度来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性世界模型方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨不同基质的目性行为提供了统一解释，挑战了传统分离的世界模型组件观点，强调了从经验中共同涌现的描述性和规范性方面的相互依赖性。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众景点获得关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成城市建议，然后通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商和精炼。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的小众景点。

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型控制群体动画中的代理人物运动，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航实现更现实的社交交互和群体行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体动画方法很少考虑语言和对话对人类导航行为的影响，交互主要限于避撕和固定目标推断，需要更现实的社交交互模拟

Method: 方法包括两个主要组件：对话系统和语言驱动导航。周期性查询基于代理人特征的LLM来生成代理人间对话，然后使用对话内容、人物性格、情感状态、视觉和身体状态来控制每个代理人的导航和行走

Result: 在复杂场景中验证方法有效，观察到代理人自动分组和解散，方法作为群体内的信息传递机制，产生了更现实的群体模拟和自然出现的群体行为

Conclusion: 该案例为群体动画提供了一种新方法，通过整合语言模型来实现更丰富的社交交互和现实的群体行为，让组织和解散行为自然涉出

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，增加推理预算反而会损害LLM的置信度校准，检索增强生成比纯推理表现更好，信息获取是置信度校准的关键瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在问答任务中的置信度校准问题，特别是推理能力和计算预算对置信度评估准确性的影响

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下LLM的置信度校准表现，比较纯推理与检索增强生成方法

Result: 推理LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会导致系统性过度自信；检索增强生成方法达到89.3%准确率，显著优于纯推理

Conclusion: 信息获取而非推理深度或推理预算是知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键限制因素，挑战了"测试时扩展"范式

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，使用MAS-SVD分析结构和SSI指标检测风险层，通过剪枝提升安全性同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）在增强LLM能力的同时可能损害安全对齐，现有安全感知方法需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1）MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性并保留全局幅度信息；2）SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3）对风险层进行后剪枝。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或提升效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Result: 用户研究表明，该工具和解释方法比传统手动解决方案能实现更快和更准确的问题解决

Conclusion: 抽象论证框架为劳动力管理提供了有效的变更适应和解释生成机制，显著提升了问题解决效率

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大型离线数据集，在开放宇宙辅助游戏中表现出色

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家建立了下一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决GUI代理在桌面和移动环境中需要处理多种任务（如基础定位、问答、规划、决策和程序知识）的挑战，需要开发一个能够端到端处理这些任务的强大模型。

Method: 提出了GUI-Owl模型，包含三个关键创新：1）大规模环境基础设施和自演进GUI轨迹生产框架；2）多样化的基础代理能力集成；3）可扩展的环境强化学习框架和轨迹感知相对策略优化。

Result: GUI-Owl-7B在AndroidWorld上达到66.4分，在OSWorld上达到29.4分。Mobile-Agent-v3进一步提升到AndroidWorld 73.3分和OSWorld 37.7分，创造了开源GUI代理框架的新纪录。

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为GUI代理领域提供了强大的基础模型和框架，通过创新的数据生成方法、能力集成和强化学习技术，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数学逻辑数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性不足的问题，需要高质量可验证的数据来增强大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 基于Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)的形式化框架，包含三个创新：种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范、通过变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体、通过重现机制确保有效性

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化程序验证谜题的基准测试集，在PuzzleClone测试集上平均准确率从14.4提升到56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得最高12.5个百分点的绝对提升

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够大规模合成高质量可验证数据，显著提升LLM的逻辑推理能力，为解决现有数据集的局限性提供了有效方案

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在医疗健康领域有应用潜力，但对于稀有疾病如多汗痆（影响2-3%人口），细调数据的稀缺和不可靠性仍是主要障碍。目前没有工作针对多汗痆进行LLM定制化。

Method: 三阶段流程：1）数据增帽阶段：使用前沿LLM从精选开源数据生成医学合理的合成案例；2）细调阶段：在开源基础模型上细调，提供诊断、个性化治疗建议和关怀心理支持；3）推理与专家评估阶段：临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和关怀度，通过迭代丰富数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架为多汗痆提供了一个可靠、关怀的解决方案，并为其他面临类似数据和可靠性挑战的稀有疾痆提供了可推广的方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在高约束条件下的排程思维可靠性未充分定性，需要一个可扩展的评测框架来分析模型在资源约束项目排程问题(RCPSP)这种NP完全问题中的表现。

Method: 建立R-ConstraintBench框架，逐步增加有向无环图(DAG)中的非冗余先后约束，然后引入停机时间、时间窗口和排他性约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中实例化评测。

Result: 强大模型在仅有先后约束的DAG上表现接近天花板，但当停机时间、时间窗口和排他性约束相互作用时，可行性性能快速呈现坏死狂涩。约束相互作用是主要瓶颈而非图的深度。

Conclusion: 模型在清洁合成数据上的良好表现不能保证在领域实际场景中的转移，显示了大语言模型在约束氛围排程任务中的有限泛化能力。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Conclusion: MMS系统能够构建高质量的长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据提升回忆性能和响应质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架，通过粗粒度到细粒度的记忆机制增强LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，解决了现有单粒度记忆方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖单粒度记忆机制，受限于经验收集质量，导致知识多样性和规划灵活性不足。需要一种更灵活的记忆框架来适应多样化场景。

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）面对异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思。

Result: 该框架能够更充分地利用记忆知识，实现灵活的场景适应，特别是在环境异常情况下能够进行有效的计划修正。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制显著提升了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的表现和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好反馈，通过相似性搜索实现精确的信用分配，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但人工设计成本高昂。人类反馈（专家演示和偏好）各有局限：演示成本高且模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配困难

Method: 提出基于搜索的偏好加权(SPW)方案，为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移搜索专家演示中最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似性得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效结合偏好和演示进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW成功解决了偏好学习中的信用分配问题，为统一不同形式的人类反馈提供了有效方案，在复杂任务中展现出优越性能

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

*Bin Deng,Yizhe Feng,Zeming Liu,Qing Wei,Xiangrong Zhu,Shuai Chen,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决了现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略多样化的环境因素和用户偏好，限制了计划的可行性；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集，支持隐式和显式查询的决策制定，包含修订需求，具备环境感知能力以确保现实场景下的可行性，并整合详细的POI信息。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 实验显示，即使最强的现有模型也仅达到1.0%的通过率，表明真实世界的旅行规划极具挑战性。相比之下，TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能提升，展现出显著改进。

Conclusion: TGMA框架为真实世界的旅行规划提供了有前景的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的关键局限性，在挑战性的真实场景中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

TL;DR: DiagECG是一个将12导联心电图信号转换为符号标记，并与大语言模型集成的新框架，用于临床文本生成任务，实现了跨任务的强性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力有限，缺乏开放式推理支持，需要一种能统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的解决方案。

Method: 使用导联独立编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上实现了强劲性能，并保持了在分布外设置下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示集成到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了更通用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define
various planning-based compilations that aim to jointly optimize both the sum
of action costs and plan disruption. Experimental results in different
benchmarks show that the reformulated task can be effectively solved in
practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.

alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and

minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

TL;DR: 提出了Think in Blocks框架，通过将推理过程划分为可调数量的块，使LLM能够根据任务复杂度动态调整推理长度，避免过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的思维链方法在处理复杂逻辑推理时表现良好，但过长的推理链会导致计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理深度的能力。

Method: 建立块结构范式：先预测推理预算（块数），然后分区推理；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的DPO、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制深度。

Result: 开发了能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的模型框架，实现了从零推理到深度推理的灵活调节。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过块结构化和自适应训练实现了推理长度的动态控制，提高了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Motivation: 随着自主人工智能代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得日益重要。受超加性合作理论启发，探索重复互动和群体间竞争如何影响AI代理的合作行为。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境博弈，同时模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动中的合作倾向。

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中的策略制定提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地促进合作行为，对设计未来多智能体AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Conclusion: DeepThink3D方法有效解决了3D场景复杂推理的挑战，通过问题复杂化和模型优化显著提升了LLM的3D推理性能。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入MBR、ASAS、TASAS等量化指标来测量策略的安全边界。

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中的实验表明，该框架能够全面且可解释地评估策略行为，成功识别仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了形式化的安全验证方法，能够识别不安全区域的安全屏障和系统的收敛特性，为安全关键应用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发向量符号的声明性记忆系统来替代ACT-R的传统DM系统，以获得更好的可扩展性、相似性处理能力，同时保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理流水线，创建基于向量表示的完整记忆块检索机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM保持了向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块即可召回），同时使先前ACT-R模型只需极少修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号记忆系统与ACT-R的集成，未来将改进时间上下文表示并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Conclusion: 该方法为MARL系统提供了新的合作动态洞察，增强了可解释性，能够识别通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益团队成功的行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [56] [Futurity as Infrastructure: A Techno-Philosophical Interpretation of the AI Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15680)
*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，提出AI数据生命周期产生递归价值链，挑战现有负责任AI框架，需要基于Simondon哲学的新监管方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统中数据的动态生命周期和递归价值创造过程，导致监管盲点，需要从技术哲学角度重新审视AI的数据流动和价值链形成。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，引入Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，建立AI生命周期模型（前个体环境、个体化、个体化AI），并提出"未来性"概念来描述AI的自我强化循环。

Result: 识别出AI数据具有递归生成性和非竞争性特征，基础设施（如特征存储）支持反馈、适应和时间递归，导致权力不对称加剧和科技寡头垄断价值创造。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度以及反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Motivation: 现有的多模态基准测试在视觉推理任务上缺乏对数据语义、结构和清晰度的严格控制，需要一种能够系统评估模型在结构化视觉内容上推理能力的统一框架。

Method: 使用Python可视化库程序化生成图表和合成渲染表格，确保对数据语义和结构的控制。每个实例包含图表/表格图像和基于视觉内容的多步骤分析问题，答案以JSON或YAML等结构化格式提供。

Result: 创建了一个包含比较、趋势识别、排序、聚合、比例估计和异常检测等多种推理类型的分类法，支持对多模态模型的全面评估。

Conclusion: GRAFT为多模态模型在视觉基础结构化推理任务上提供了统一、可扩展的细粒度基准测试框架，为该领域设立了新的评估标准。

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at
https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在生产环境中测量AI推理工作负载环境影响的综合方法，发现Gemini AI助手的文本提示能消耗较低（中位数0.24Wh），并显示谨林的效率优化和清洁能源采购带来了显著的环境改善效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI用户采用加速，需要理解和减少AI服务的环境影响，但目前没有研究在生产环境中测量过AI服务的环境指标。

Method: 提出并执行了一种综合方法，在大规模AI生产环境中测量AI推理工作负载的能消、碳排放和水消耗，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能消、空闲机器容量和数据中心能消过重。

Result: 发现Gemini Apps文本提示的中位数能消为0.24Wh，显著低于公众估计。谨林的软件效率优化和清洁能源采购在一年内导致了能消减少33倍和碳踹迹减少44倍。每个提示消耗的能量少于看9秒电视，水消耗等同于5滴水。

Conclusion: 虽然Gemini AI的环境影响较低，但减少AI服务的环境影响仍需要重视。综合测量AI服务环境指标对准确比较模型和正确激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用语言模型实时评估对话中的假社交线索，通过五段测试在前几轮对话中准确检测所有假社交对话而无误报


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能代理引发的假社交关系对人类健康造成严重危害，但防止这种动态面临挑战，因为假社交线索逐渐在私密对话中出现，且不是所有情感参与都有害

Method: 重新调整最先进的语言模型，创建了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估进行中对话的假社交线索，使用30个涵盖假社交、娌婷和中性对话的合成数据集进行测试

Result: 在宽松的一致性规则下，迭代评估成功识别了所有假社交对话，同时避免了误报，检测通常在对话的前几次交换中就发生

Conclusion: 这些发现为评估代理能够提供防止假社交关系的可行解决方案提供了预期证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGT是一个基于多智能体大语言模型的配置优化框架，通过自然语言推理和文本梯度来协调模型架构、训练策略和超参数的联合优化，在保持高可解释性的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性且处理维度独立，自动化方法难以实现动态适应性和语义推理。需要一种能够理解配置间相互依赖关系并进行智能推理的优化框架。

Method: 提出语言引导调优(LGT)框架，使用多智能体LLM通过自然语言推理进行配置优化。引入文本梯度作为定性反馈信号，协调三个专业智能体：提出配置变更的顾问、评估进展的评估器和精化决策过程的优化器，形成自改进反馈循环。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，LGT相比传统优化方法实现了显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时获得了性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过多智能体语言模型和文本梯度的结合，成功解决了配置优化中的语义推理和动态适应性问题，为机器学习配置优化提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.
