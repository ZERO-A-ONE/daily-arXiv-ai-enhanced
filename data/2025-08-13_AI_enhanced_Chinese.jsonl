However, it exposes a new class of timing\nside-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via\nshared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from\n50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using\nthis internal logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u2014\u2014\u62d3\u6251\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08TCMs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3001\u6781\u9650\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86TCMs\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3001\u6781\u9650\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u6362\u8861\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86TCMs\u7684\u8303\u7574\u662f\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u9650\u6216\u4f59\u6781\u9650\u201c\u6c42\u89e3\u201d\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "TCMs\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from\nthese semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent\nprompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.\nOur results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings\nstatistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\\% AUC) of the\nevaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging\nrandomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,\nour approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context\nprediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated\nprojects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software\nengineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership\nsignals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware\napproach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and\nobservability.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniLLP\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6240\u6709\u6743\u805a\u7c7b\u6539\u8fdb\u65e5\u5fd7\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM-based LLPs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e5\u5fd7\u7ea7\u522b\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM-based LLPs\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "OmniLLP\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6587\u4ef6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u805a\u7c7b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08AUC\u63d0\u53478%\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u8fbe0.88-0.96 AUC\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6240\u6709\u6743\u4fe1\u53f7\u6574\u5408\u5230LLM-LLPs\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer\n(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate\nmultidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response\ngeneration. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary\ninformation with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,\nwe achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast\nto existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to\nambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes\ncompleteness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting\nhuman input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also\nadopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,\nthereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency.

One weakness of MCTS is\nthat it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.

Built on the\nGeneral Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of\narcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that\ndiffer from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game\ndescription language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,\nhelping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a\ncompact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language\nmodels. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step\nratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through\nzero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse\nchallenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial\nreasoning and basic planning.
