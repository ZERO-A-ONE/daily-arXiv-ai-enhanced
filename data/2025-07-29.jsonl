However, existing mechanisms overlook the\nmemorability demands on users for recovery, such as the need to recall a\nthreshold number of trustees. Therefore, we first formalize the notion of\nrecovery metadata in the context of social key recovery, illustrating the\ntradeoff between easing the burden of memorizing the metadata and maintaining\nmetadata privacy. We present Apollo, the first framework that addresses this\ntradeoff by distributing indistinguishable data within a user's social circle,\nwhere trustees hold relevant data and non-trustees store random data. Apollo\neliminates the need to memorize recovery metadata since a user eventually\ngathers sufficient data from her social circle for recovery. Due to\nindistinguishability, Apollo protects metadata privacy by forming an anonymity\nset that hides the trustees among non-trustees. To make the anonymity set\nscalable, Apollo proposes a novel multi-layered secret sharing scheme that\nmitigates the overhead due to the random data distributed among non-trustees.\nFinally, we provide a prototype implementation of Apollo and report on its\nperformance. Apollo reduces the chances of malicious recovery to between 0.005%\nand 1.8%, depending on the adversary's ability to compromise. The multi-layered\ndesign shows a latency reduction from 1.1x to 740kx compared to a\nsingle-layered approach, depending on the number of reconnections."}

To further explore the field of backdoor attacks\nagainst semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective\nbackdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg\nleverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models\nto enhance backdoor performance.

The\nmodel is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,\nbenchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with\nweighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network\ncomplexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable\nsimulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across\nsupply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing\nobjectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the\nprimary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,\ndiversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that\nallows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up\nto 75\\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions\nthat are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than\nthose produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures\nstable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss."}

Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated\nsub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore\ncannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world\npractice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also\nneglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow\nset of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this\npaper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique\nexpressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in\nthree phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts\nguide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all\ncontrol-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and\ncontext-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs.

Our design is\nmotivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared\nto coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to\ntest; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that\ndomain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code\nand a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal\ncomment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the\nproject to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test\ngeneration problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the\nvalidation intention. It generates a test including both test prefix and\noracle, which aims to be executable and semantically correct.\n  We evaluate IntentionTest against state-of-the-art baselines on 4,146 test\ncases from 13 open-source projects. Specifically, compared to ChatTester,\nIntentionTest can (1) generate significantly more semantically correct tests,\nimproving common mutation scores by 39.03% and coverage overlap with\nground-truth tests by 40.14%; (2) generate 21.30% more successful passing\ntests."}

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.

However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique.

To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive\nfuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional\narchitecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding\nwindow to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction\nstrategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short\nand long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to\nautomatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships\namong them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require\nhuman involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce\ncalculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global\ncharacteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing\nredundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a\npartially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly\nmine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which\ngives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct\nsub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained\nlevel.

However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors\nthat remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated\nthreat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can\nexploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a\nproof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as\nbenign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal\nuser account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical\nknowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a\ncritical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers\nmay appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server\nattack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume\nsophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for\nMCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level\nPython knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit\nthe implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool\nproviders. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by\ndemonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server\nattacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to\nsecure this emerging ecosystem."}

While recent advances leverage\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nmodels with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear\nacross diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically\ninvestigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code\npreferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we\nhypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal\nsolutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore\nsuperior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal\nsolutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive\nPreference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively\namplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages\nexploration of potentially superior solutions during training.

Most existing ownership protection\nsolutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based\nAI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale\ndistribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a\nunique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and\nmodifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking\nmethod. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently\nembedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nmodule, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through\nbranch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the\nwatermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without\ndegrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is\ncompatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including\nclassification, image generation, and text generation.
