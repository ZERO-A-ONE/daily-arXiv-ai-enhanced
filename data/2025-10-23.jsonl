The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop.

Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time\nmodel-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before\nit reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning\non simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data\nto selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt\ninjection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs'\nutility.

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation\npipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then\nto an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the\nhetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP\ncontext as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that\nthe RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an\nillustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the\nspecialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit\nexplanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.\nOverall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while\naccommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes\nencountered in large, complex megaprojects."}

However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward\nhacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They\nachieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting\nspurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)\nthat correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than\ngenuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing\nthese issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking\nproblem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach\nto mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by\nthe invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based\nReward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant\nkernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective.

While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been\nwidely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because\nthe term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand.

We present RLIE, a unified framework that\nintegrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.\nRLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters\ncandidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for\nglobal selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the\nrule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the\nweighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an\nLLM.

To remedy this risk, researchers and companies have developed various\ndependency scanners, which try to identify inclusions of known-to-be-vulnerable\nOSS dependencies.

In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based\narchitecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on\nmemory-intensive, long-horizon tasks.
