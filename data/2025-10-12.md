### [1] [Modeling Developer Burnout with GenAI Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07435)
*Zixuan Feng,Sadia Afroz,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现生成式AI的采用通过增加工作需求加剧了开发者的职业倦怠，但工作资源和积极认知可以缓解这种负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究强调生成式AI带来的生产力提升，但其采用也可能引入新的压力，影响开发者福祉。本文旨在探究生成式AI采用与开发者职业倦怠之间的关系。

Method: 采用嵌入式混合方法研究设计，结合定量和定性证据。首先调查了442名开发者，然后使用PLS-SEM和回归分析建模工作需求、工作资源与职业倦怠的关系，并通过定性分析开放式回答来补充定量发现。

Result: 结果显示生成式AI采用通过增加工作需求加剧职业倦怠，而工作资源和对生成式AI的积极认知能够缓解这些影响，将采用重新定义为机遇。

Conclusion: 生成式AI采用既带来挑战也创造机遇，组织需要平衡工作需求与资源，并培养对AI的积极认知，以减轻对开发者福祉的负面影响。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

### [2] [HotBugs.jar: A Benchmark of Hot Fixes for Time-Critical Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07529)
*Carol Hanna,Federica Sarro,Mark Harman,Justyna Petke*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HotBugs.jar是首个专门针对真实世界热修复的数据集，包含679个经过人工验证的热修复案例，其中110个可复现，为快速调试、自动修复和生产级韧性研究提供基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热修复是解决生产系统时间关键问题的紧急变更，但现有评估基准缺乏专门针对热修复的数据集，阻碍了相关工具的研究和评估。

Method: 通过挖掘10个Apache项目的19万次提交和15万份问题报告，识别746个候选热修复补丁，经过人工评估确认679个真实热修复，其中110个可复现，并集成到Bugs.jar框架中。

Result: 构建了包含679个验证热修复的数据集，其中110个可复现案例，每个案例包含错误和修复版本、测试套件和元数据，已被SBSE会议挑战赛道采纳为官方数据集。

Conclusion: HotBugs.jar填补了热修复研究领域的空白，为快速调试、自动修复和生产级韧性工具的开发与评估提供了重要基准，推动了这一关键领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern
software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.

### [3] [RustAssure: Differential Symbolic Testing for LLM-Transpiled C-to-Rust Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07604)
*Yubo Bai,Tapti Palit*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RustAssure是一个使用大语言模型自动将C代码库转译为Rust的系统，通过提示工程和差分符号测试确保生成的Rust代码既符合语言习惯又语义正确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了利用Rust的内存安全特性提升软件安全性，需要将现有用不安全内存语言（如C）编写的代码库转译为Rust。

Method: 使用大语言模型自动转译C代码到Rust，通过提示工程技术生成符合习惯的安全Rust代码，并采用差分符号测试验证C和Rust代码的语义相似性。

Result: 在5个真实世界应用和库的评估中，系统能为89.8%的C函数生成可编译的Rust函数，其中69.9%的函数在C和Rust版本中产生了等价的符号返回值。

Conclusion: RustAssure系统能够有效自动转译C代码到Rust，生成大量可编译且语义正确的Rust代码，为利用Rust安全特性提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

### [4] [AppForge: From Assistant to Independent Developer -- Are GPTs Ready for Software Development?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07740)
*Dezhi Ran,Yuan Cao,Mengzhou Wu,Simin Chen,Yuzhe Guo,Jun Ren,Zihe Song,Hao Yu,Jialei Wei,Linyi Li,Wei Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Tao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APPFORGE是一个包含101个真实Android应用开发问题的基准测试，用于评估LLM从零构建完整软件系统的能力。测试结果显示当前LLM在此任务上表现较差，最佳模型GPT-5仅能开发18.8%功能正确的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注函数级代码生成，但真实软件开发需要协调多个组件、管理应用状态和生命周期。需要评估LLM是否能够构建完整的软件系统。

Method: 设计多智能体系统自动从应用文档中总结主要功能并导航应用以合成测试用例，构建包含自动化评估框架的基准测试，对12个主流LLM进行评估。

Result: 所有评估模型效果都很低，最佳模型GPT-5仅能开发18.8%功能正确的应用，表明当前模型在处理复杂多组件软件工程挑战方面存在根本性局限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在构建完整软件系统方面能力有限，需要进一步研究来提升模型处理复杂软件工程任务的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

### [5] [Interleaved Learning and Exploration: A Self-Adaptive Fuzz Testing Framework for MLIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07815)
*Zeyu Sun,Jingjing Liang,Weiyi Wang,Chenyao Suo,Junjie Chen,Fanjiang Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLEX是一个基于神经网络的MLIR自适应模糊测试框架，通过扰动采样和反馈驱动的增强循环，能自主生成高质量测试用例，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模板或规则变异的模糊测试方法难以生成足够多样且语义有效的测试用例，无法有效发现MLIR复杂代码库中的深层错误。

Method: 使用神经网络进行程序生成，采用扰动采样策略促进多样性，并通过反馈驱动的增强循环迭代改进模型，利用崩溃和非崩溃测试用例进行学习。

Result: 在30天测试中发现80个未知错误，包括多个新根本原因和解析器错误；在24小时固定版本比较中检测到53个错误（比最佳基线多3.5倍），代码覆盖率达到28.2%，比次优工具高42%。

Conclusion: FLEX通过结合神经网络生成、扰动采样和多样性增强，显著提升了MLIR模糊测试的效果，证实了扰动生成和多样性增强在框架有效性中的关键作用。

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

### [6] [Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834)
*Lingjun Liu,Feiran Qin,Owolabi Legunsen,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IssueMut从编译器bug历史中提取变异器，用于改进编译器模糊测试，在GCC和LLVM中发现了65个新bug


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器bug影响巨大，现有变异模糊测试器依赖变异器质量，但从未利用编译器bug历史作为变异器来源

Method: 从1760个GCC和LLVM bug报告中自动挖掘587个变异器，并集成到现有变异编译器模糊测试器中

Result: 发现了65个新bug（GCC 28个，LLVM 37个），其中60个被确认或修复

Conclusion: bug历史包含丰富信息，编译器模糊测试器应充分利用这些信息

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

### [7] [An AUTOSAR-Aligned Architectural Study of Vulnerabilities in Automotive SoC Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07941)
*Srijita Basu,Haraldsson Bengt,Miroslaw Staron,Christian Berger,Jennifer Horkoff,Magnus Almgren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了180个公开报告的汽车SoC漏洞，识别了16个根本原因和56个受影响的软件模块，揭示了主要的漏洞模式和关键模块的补丁延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车SoC软件架构在AUTOSAR标准下仍面临安全挑战，缺乏对SoC相关漏洞根本原因和影响的系统性分析。

Method: 分析180个公开报告的汽车SoC漏洞，映射到符合AUTOSAR原则的代表性SoC软件架构模型。

Result: 识别了16个根本原因和56个受影响软件模块，发现在CWE类别和架构层之间存在缓解延迟，揭示了主导的漏洞模式和补丁延迟较长的关键模块。

Conclusion: 为保护汽车CPS平台提供了可操作的见解，包括改进检测、优先级排序和定位策略的指南。

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

### [8] [Past, Present, and Future of Bug Tracking in the Generative AI Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08005)
*Utku Boran Torun,Mehmet Taha Demircan,Mahmut Furkan Gön,Eray Tüzün*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的AI驱动bug跟踪框架，通过智能自动化减少修复时间和人工开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统bug跟踪系统依赖人工报告、复现、分类和解决，流程异步且沟通成本高，导致修复延迟和用户不满

Method: 用户用自然语言报告问题，AI代理完善报告、尝试复现并请求缺失细节，然后分类报告、通过无代码修复解决无效问题，对有效问题进行定位并分配给开发者，LLM生成候选补丁，人工监督确保正确性

Result: 框架在每个阶段集成自动化，加速响应时间，改善协作，加强软件维护实践

Conclusion: AI驱动的bug跟踪框架为更高效、以用户为中心的未来提供了解决方案

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

### [9] [Building Whitespace-Sensitive Languages Using Whitespace-Insensitive Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08200)
*Alexander Hellwig,Nico Jansen,Bernhard Rumpe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过预处理语言构件来构建空格敏感语言的技术，解决了空格敏感和不敏感语言组件之间的集成鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件语言工程中，模块化语言组件的可重用性受到空格敏感和不敏感语言集成鸿沟的严重限制，导致库无法重用，空格敏感语言需要从头开发。

Method: 通过预处理语言构件，使用模块化的空格不敏感语言模块来构建空格敏感语言。

Result: 通过重构简化版Python语言来评估该方法，验证了技术的可行性。

Conclusion: 该解决方案提高了现有语言组件的可重用性，减少了开发时间并提升了软件语言的整体质量。

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

### [10] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出PATCH方法，通过识别和编辑语言模型中的PII泄漏电路来减少隐私泄露，相比现有防御机制在隐私-效用权衡方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可能从训练数据中记忆个人身份信息，现有防御机制如差分隐私虽然能减少泄漏但会导致效用大幅下降。

Method: 使用电路发现技术识别PII泄漏电路，然后直接编辑这些电路来减少泄漏。

Result: PATCH将PII泄漏召回率降低高达65%，与差分隐私结合可将残余泄漏召回率降至0.01%。

Conclusion: PII泄漏电路在现有防御机制后仍然存在，而PATCH能有效减轻其影响，实现更好的隐私-效用平衡。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

*Kalyan Cheerla,Lotfi Ben Othmane,Kirill Morozov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 比较全同态加密(FHE)和混淆电路(GC)在安全神经网络推理中的性能表现，发现GC在速度和内存使用上有优势，而FHE支持非交互式推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在医疗、金融等敏感领域的应用，数据隐私和模型保密性需求日益增长，隐私保护机器学习(PPML)成为重要研究方向

Method: 使用Microsoft SEAL库的CKKS方案实现FHE，使用IntelLabs的TinyGarble2.0框架实现GC，在半诚实威胁模型下评估两层神经网络

Result: GC在推理时间和内存消耗上表现更好，FHE支持非交互式推理，两者存在性能权衡

Conclusion: FHE和GC各有优势，选择取决于具体应用场景对交互性和性能的要求

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is making its way into fields such as healthcare,
finance, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and concerns over data privacy
and model confidentiality continue to grow. Privacy-preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without
revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary models. Leveraging Secure Computation
techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work
presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network
inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS
scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework
(GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest
threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory
usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a
trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption,
while FHE supports non-interactive inference.

*Maryam Ataei Nezhad,Hamid Barati,Ali Barati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三层安全通信方法，通过星型结构、多跳加密和认证协议来保护物联网通信安全，在能耗、延迟、灵活性等方面均有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在家庭、组织和公司中广泛应用后，隐私和信息安全成为最大担忧，用户信息被黑客窃取的问题阻碍了物联网的普及。

Method: 采用三层方法：1）在集群内构建星型结构，子节点与父节点共享唯一密钥加密通信；2）集群内多跳通信，每跳使用不同密钥加密，连接结束后更新密钥；3）使用认证协议增强集群间通信安全，防止恶意节点。

Result: 使用NS2软件模拟显示，该方法在能耗、端到端延迟、灵活性、数据包投递率和存活节点数量方面均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的三层安全通信方法能有效保护物联网通信安全，在多个性能指标上都有显著改进。

Abstract: Internet of Things means connecting different devices through the Internet.
The Internet of things enables humans to remotely manage and control the
objects they use with the Internet infrastructure. After the advent of the
Internet of Things in homes, organizations, and private companies, privacy and
information security are the biggest concern. This issue has challenged the
spread of the Internet of things as news of the users theft of information by
hackers intensified. The proposed method in this paper consists of three
phases. In the first phase, a star structure is constructed within each
cluster, and a unique key is shared between each child and parent to encrypt
and secure subsequent communications. The second phase is for intracluster
communications, in which members of the cluster send their data to the cluster
head in a multi hop manner. Also, in this phase, the data is encrypted with
different keys in each hop, and at the end of each connection, the keys are
updated to ensure data security. The third phase is to improve the security of
inter cluster communications using an authentication protocol. In this way, the
cluster heads are authenticated before sending information to prevent malicious
nodes in the network. The proposed method is also simulated using NS2 software.
The results showed that the proposed method has improved in terms of energy
consumption, end-to-end delay, flexibility, packet delivery rate, and the
number of alive nodes compared to other methods.

### [13] [MIRANDA: short signatures from a leakage-free full-domain-hash scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07479)
*Alain Couvreur,Thomas Debris-Alazard,Philippe Gaborit,Adrien Vinçotte*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Miranda是基于矩阵码的第一个全域哈希签名方案，采用GPV范式提供强安全保证。该方案使用简单的子码陷门结构，无需拒绝采样，签名大小仅90字节，公钥大小约2.6MB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发首个基于矩阵码的全域哈希签名方案，避免复杂拒绝采样过程，简化实现难度，同时提供强安全保证。

Method: 使用Gabidulin码作为矩阵空间，基于GPV范式构建签名方案。陷门结构简单通用，仅涉及可解码码的子码，通过少量均匀比特绘制确保签名不泄露陷门信息。

Result: 在128位经典安全级别下，签名大小仅90字节，公钥大小约2.6MB，实现了紧凑的签名方案。

Conclusion: Miranda成功构建了首个基于矩阵码的GPV签名方案，具有简单实现、强安全性和紧凑签名的优势。

Abstract: We present $\mathsf{Miranda}$, the first family of full-domain-hash
signatures based on matrix codes. This signature scheme fulfils the paradigm of
Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan ($\mathsf{GPV}$), which gives strong
security guarantees. Our trapdoor is very simple and generic: if we propose it
with matrix codes, it can actually be instantiated in many other ways since it
only involves a subcode of a decodable code (or lattice) in a unique decoding
regime of parameters. Though $\mathsf{Miranda}$ signing algorithm relies on a
decoding task where there is exactly one solution, there are many possible
signatures given a message to sign and we ensure that signatures are not
leaking information on their underlying trapdoor by means of a very simple
procedure involving the drawing of a small number of uniform bits. In
particular $\mathsf{Miranda}$ does not use a rejection sampling procedure which
makes its implementation a very simple task contrary to other
$\mathsf{GPV}$-like signatures schemes such as $\mathsf{Falcon}$ or even
$\mathsf{Wave}$.
  We instantiate $\mathsf{Miranda}$ with the famous family of Gabidulin codes
represented as spaces of matrices and we study thoroughly its security (in the
EUF-CMA security model). For~$128$ bits of classical security, the signature
sizes are as low as~$90$ bytes and the public key sizes are in the order
of~$2.6$ megabytes.

*Haowen Xu,Tianya Zhao,Xuyu Wang,Lei Ma,Jun Dai,Alexander Wyglinski,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMPalm是一个攻击框架，能够从掌纹识别设备泄漏的电磁信号中恢复掌纹和掌静脉图像，对生物识别安全构成威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现掌纹识别系统在运行时会无意中泄漏电磁信号，这些信号包含生物特征信息，可能被恶意利用。

Method: 首先分离两种模态的交错传输，识别并组合信息频段，然后重建图像，最后使用扩散模型恢复细粒度生物特征。

Result: 在7个原型和2个商用设备上测试，EMPalm能以高视觉保真度恢复生物信息，SSIM达0.79，PSNR达29.88 dB，FID低至6.82。

Conclusion: 该攻击对4个先进掌纹识别模型的平均欺骗成功率达65.30%，揭示了掌纹识别系统的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Palm recognition has emerged as a dominant biometric authentication
technology in critical infrastructure. These systems operate in either
single-modal form, using palmprint or palmvein individually, or dual-modal
form, fusing the two modalities. Despite this diversity, they share similar
hardware architectures that inadvertently emit electromagnetic (EM) signals
during operation. Our research reveals that these EM emissions leak palm
biometric information, motivating us to develop EMPalm--an attack framework
that covertly recovers both palmprint and palmvein images from eavesdropped EM
signals. Specifically, we first separate the interleaved transmissions of the
two modalities, identify and combine their informative frequency bands, and
reconstruct the images. To further enhance fidelity, we employ a diffusion
model to restore fine-grained biometric features unique to each domain.
Evaluations on seven prototype and two commercial palm acquisition devices show
that EMPalm can recover palm biometric information with high visual fidelity,
achieving SSIM scores up to 0.79, PSNR up to 29.88 dB, and FID scores as low as
6.82 across all tested devices, metrics that collectively demonstrate strong
structural similarity, high signal quality, and low perceptual discrepancy. To
assess the practical implications of the attack, we further evaluate it against
four state-of-the-art palm recognition models, achieving a model-wise average
spoofing success rate of 65.30% over 6,000 samples from 100 distinct users.

### [15] [A Minrank-based Encryption Scheme à la Alekhnovich-Regev](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07584)
*Thomas Debris-Alazard,Philippe Gaborit,Romaric Neveu,Olivier Ruatta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了基于stationary-MinRank问题安全性的公钥加密方案，这是首个仅依赖MinRank问题难度的加密方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建仅基于MinRank问题难度的加密方案是一个长期存在的开放问题，此前Alekhnovich和Regev的方案基于随机线性码解码和LWE问题

Method: 通过证明stationary-MinRank问题具有搜索到决策的归约特性，构建了基于该问题的加密方案

Result: 方案具有实际可行性，效率优于Alekhnovich和Regev原始方案，略低于FrodoKEM，但可通过增加结构进一步优化

Conclusion: 该方案为仅依赖MinRank问题难度的加密方案提供了部分答案，具有强安全性保证且具有竞争力

Abstract: Introduced in 2003 and 2005, Alekhnovich and Regev' schemes were the first
public-key encryptions whose security is only based on the average hardness of
decoding random linear codes and LWE, without other security assumptions. Such
security guarantees made them very popular, being at the origin of the now
standardized HQC or Kyber.
  We present an adaptation of Alekhnovich and Regev' encryption scheme whose
security is only based on the hardness of a slight variation of MinRank, the
so-called stationary-MinRank problem. We succeeded to reach this strong
security guarantee by showing that stationary-MinRank benefits from a
search-to-decision reduction. Our scheme therefore brings a partial answer to
the long-standing open question of building an encryption scheme whose security
relies solely on the hardness of MinRank.
  Finally, we show after a thoroughly security analysis that our scheme is
practical and competitive with other encryption schemes admitting such strong
security guarantees. Our scheme is slightly less efficient than FrodoKEM, but
much more efficient than Alekhnovich and Regev' original schemes, with
possibilities of improvements by considering more structure, in the same way as
HQC and Kyber.

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models
(LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves
LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks,
as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks.
Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive
overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting
LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward
providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by
analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and
unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a
unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing
reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also
present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges
alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel
perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy
LLM communities.

### [17] [ANCORA: Accurate Intrusion Recovery for Web Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07806)
*Yihao Peng,Biao Ma,Hai Wan,Xibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ANCORA是一个用于Web应用程序精确入侵恢复的系统，能够在不进行侵入式插桩的情况下，通过隔离恶意请求触发的系统调用序列，分别追踪文件和数据库修改，实现选择性回滚和重放恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Web应用恢复面临关键困境：粗粒度的快照回滚会导致合法用户数据丢失，而精确移除攻击影响在高并发环境中难以实现，因为难以将文件和数据库修改归因于特定的攻击相关请求。

Method: ANCORA首先隔离单个恶意请求触发的完整系统调用序列，然后分别处理文件和数据库修改。对于文件追踪，构建溯源图揭示所有修改；对于数据库操作，引入新颖的时空锚点，使用请求的网络连接元组和活动时间窗口来精确定位操作。

Result: 在10个Web应用和20个基于CVE的攻击场景中，ANCORA实现了99.9%的恢复准确率，在最坏情况下响应延迟增加19.8%、QPS下降17.8%，恢复吞吐量为每秒110.7个数据库操作和27.2个受影响文件。

Conclusion: ANCORA能够完全移除攻击影响，同时保留并发合法数据，为Web应用提供精确的入侵恢复解决方案。

Abstract: Modern web application recovery presents a critical dilemma. Coarse-grained
snapshot rollbacks cause unacceptable data loss for legitimate users.
Surgically removing an attack's impact is hindered by a fundamental challenge
in high-concurrency environments: it is difficult to attribute resulting file
and database modifications to a specific attack-related request. We present
ANCORA, a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications without
invasive instrumentation. ANCORA first isolates the full sequence of syscalls
triggered by a single malicious request. Based on this sequence, ANCORA
addresses file and database modifications separately. To trace file changes, it
builds a provenance graph that reveals all modifications, including those by
exploit-spawned processes. To attribute database operations, a more difficult
challenge due to connection pooling, ANCORA introduces a novel spatiotemporal
anchor. This anchor uses the request's network connection tuple and active time
window to pinpoint exact database operations. With all malicious file and
database operations precisely identified, ANCORA performs a unified rewind and
selective replay recovery. It reverts the system to a clean snapshot taken
before the attack, then selectively re-applies only legitimate operations to
both the file system and database. This completely removes the attack's effects
while preserving concurrent legitimate data. We evaluated ANCORA on 10 web
applications and 20 CVE-based attack scenarios with concurrency up to 150
connections. Experiments demonstrate ANCORA achieves 99.9% recovery accuracy
with manageable overhead: up to 19.8% response latency increase and 17.8% QPS
decrease in worst cases, and recovery throughput of 110.7 database operations
per second and 27.2 affected files per second, effectively preserving
legitimate data.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种针对大型视觉语言模型移动代理的实用隐蔽单次越狱攻击，利用应用内提示注入，通过恶意应用在UI文本中嵌入短提示，仅在代理通过ADB驱动UI时暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖显眼的UI覆盖层、提升权限或不切实际的威胁模型，限制了隐蔽性和实际应用性，而移动代理对UI级攻击的脆弱性研究严重不足。

Method: 框架包含三个关键组件：低权限感知链目标定位、隐蔽的用户不可见激活机制，以及单次提示有效性算法（HG-IDA*），通过物理触摸属性区分代理与人类触摸，仅在代理操作时暴露有效载荷。

Result: 在多个LVLM后端（包括闭源服务和代表性开源模型）和三个Android应用中评估，观察到单次场景下高规划和高执行劫持率（如GPT-4o：82.5%规划/75.0%执行）。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前移动代理中存在基本安全漏洞，对自主智能手机操作具有直接安全影响。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,
keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate
across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we
observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios
(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a
fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate
implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

TL;DR: 提出基于数字孪生的动态去中心化区块链管理机制，通过二级区块链系统实现决策共识，在保持去中心化的同时实现区块链动态管理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区块链治理方案在控制与去中心化之间存在权衡，需要解决区块链系统的动态管理问题而不牺牲去中心化特性

Method: 利用多个由利益相关方控制的数字孪生，将其组织在二级区块链系统中，通过该系统的共识机制协调决策并传播到被管理的区块链

Result: 模拟评估显示该机制能够快速达成决策共识，并以最小开销重新配置主区块链

Conclusion: 该机制成功实现了无需集中控制的区块链系统管理，在保持去中心化的同时提供了动态管理能力

Abstract: The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current
solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off
between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes
a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital
twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple
digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate
decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary
blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions
to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems
without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and
impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted
through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to
reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain
with minimal overhead.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrossRiskEval评估框架，发现LLM防御策略在针对单一风险时可能对其他风险维度产生负面副作用，揭示了冲突纠缠神经元的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM防御策略评估大多孤立进行，忽视了防御措施在安全、公平和隐私等不同风险维度之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 提出CrossRiskEval综合评估框架，对14个部署了12种不同防御策略的LLM进行实证研究，包括细粒度神经元级分析。

Result: 发现防御策略存在显著副作用：安全防御可能放大隐私泄露或偏见输出；公平防御增加滥用和隐私泄露风险；隐私防御损害安全性并加剧偏见。

Conclusion: 呼吁LLM风险评估范式转变，转向全面、交互感知的防御策略评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various
applications, but their deployment in sensitive domains raises significant
concerns. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been
proposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation,
overlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work,
we take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by
defenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness,
and privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation
framework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk
inadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14
defense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal
several alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses
to sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect
privacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of
misuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and
exacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to
uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the
existence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing
sensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency
analysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key
role in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense
deployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward
holistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies.

Motivation: 为从通用计算中生成可证明均匀的随机性提供理论基础，通过将微架构时序波动转化为均匀随机性来确保密码学纯度。

Method: 建立连接时序分布特征函数和置换计数概率生成函数的功能关系框架，实现熵纯化，通过几何收敛将时序波动转化为均匀随机性。

Result: 实验验证了收敛定理，在多种平台上实现了每字节超过7.9998比特的香农熵和卡方均匀性。

Conclusion: 该组合定律为从通用计算中生成可证明均匀随机性提供了通用基础，从涌现的计算动力学中确保密码学纯度。

Abstract: We present the discovery of a fundamental composition law governing conjugate
observables in the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS). The law links the
discrete permutation count Np and the continuous elapsed time T through a
functional relation connecting the characteristic function of timing
distributions to the probability generating function of permutation counts.
This framework enables entropy purification, transforming microarchitectural
timing fluctuations into uniform randomness via geometric convergence. We
establish convergence theorems with explicit bounds and validate the results
experimentally, achieving Shannon entropy above 7.9998 bits per byte and
chi-square uniformity across diverse platforms. The composition law provides a
universal foundation for generating provably uniform randomness from
general-purpose computation, securing cryptographic purity from emergent
computational dynamics.

Result: LLMs在多种分类场景中表现出色，能够作为分析网络安全和隐私趋势的实用工具。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为实现有针对性的网站测量研究的有效工具，通过其语义理解能力增强网络安全和隐私研究。

Abstract: Web measurements are a well-established methodology for assessing the
security and privacy landscape of the Internet. However, existing top lists of
popular websites commonly used as measurement targets are unlabeled and lack
semantic information about the nature of the sites they include. This
limitation makes targeted measurements challenging, as researchers often need
to rely on ad-hoc techniques to bias their datasets toward specific categories
of interest. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) as a means to enable targeted web measurement studies through their
semantic understanding capabilities. Building on prior literature, we identify
key website classification tasks relevant to web measurements and construct
datasets to systematically evaluate the performance of different LLMs on these
tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may achieve strong performance across
multiple classification scenarios. We then conduct LLM-assisted web measurement
studies inspired by prior work and rigorously assess the validity of the
resulting research inferences. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a
practical tool for analyzing security and privacy trends on the Web.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量应用修改来实现数据溯源和合规性，TracE2E旨在通过易于集成的方式解决这一问题。

Method: 通过包装Rust标准库的IO模块来中介进程的输入输出，记录溯源信息并执行依赖溯源的数据保护策略。

Result: TracE2E能够跨节点一致地记录溯源信息，其合规层可以适应多种策略的执行。

Conclusion: TracE2E提供了一种无需大量修改应用的轻量级解决方案，实现了跨节点的数据可解释性和合规性。

Abstract: This paper presents TracE2E, a middleware written in Rust, that can provide
both data explainability and compliance across multiple nodes. By mediating
inputs and outputs of processes, TracE2E records provenance information and
enforces data-protection policies (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) that
depend on the recorded provenance. Unlike existing approaches that necessitate
substantial application modifications, TracE2E is designed for easy integration
into existing and future applications through a wrapper of the Rust standard
library's IO module. We describe how TracE2E consistently records provenance
information across nodes, and we demonstrate how the compliance layer of
TracE2E can accommodate the enforcement of multiple policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V指令集架构日益流行，但缺乏评估具体处理器实现安全性的工具，而Intel x86-64和ARM等流行处理器家族已有专门的微架构侧信道漏洞评估工具和基准测试。

Method: 移植Intel x86-64的缓存时序漏洞基准测试套件到RISC-V，并使用该基准测试评估三个商用RISC-V处理器的安全性能。

Result: C910处理器表现出更多不同的时序类型，表明在该处理器上运行的代码可能面临更多微架构漏洞源。37.5%的漏洞在所有处理器中都存在，只有6.8%的漏洞在所有核心中都不存在。

Conclusion: 移植的基准测试套件旨在支持RISC-V处理器设计者早期识别泄漏源，并支持开发相应的防护措施。

Abstract: While interest in the open RISC-V instruction set architecture is growing,
tools to assess the security of concrete processor implementations are lacking.
There are dedicated tools and benchmarks for common microarchitectural
side-channel vulnerabilities for popular processor families such as Intel
x86-64 or ARM, but not for RISC-V. In this paper we describe our efforts in
porting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities
to RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate the security of three
commercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54
and U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing
types than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on
the C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In
addition, our evaluation reveals that $37.5\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered
by the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\%$ are absent from
all cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V
processor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to
support the development of countermeasures.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了基于xLSTM和Transformer的深度学习入侵检测系统，用于保护ADS-B协议安全，xLSTM模型在检测性能上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着航空交通管理对易受攻击的ADS-B协议的依赖增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要，需要改进基于AI的入侵检测系统。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和扩展LSTM网络两种深度学习模型，采用迁移学习策略：先在良性ADS-B消息上预训练，再用包含篡改消息的标记数据微调。

Result: xLSTM模型达到98.9%的F1分数，优于Transformer模型的94.3%，在未见攻击测试中验证了泛化能力。xLSTM延迟7.26秒，Transformer延迟2.1秒但检测性能较低。

Conclusion: xLSTM模型在检测性能上表现优异，其延迟在SSR刷新间隔内可接受，但可能对时间关键操作有限制；Transformer模型延迟较低但检测性能不足。

Abstract: With the growing reliance on the vulnerable Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol in air traffic management (ATM),
ensuring security is critical. This study investigates emerging machine
learning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two
deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the
other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first
xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving
pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data
containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach
outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that
progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an
F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on
unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.
Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the
xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh
interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.
While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at
the cost of lower detection performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一个Haskell到布尔电路的转译器，支持全同态加密，并实现了电路的自动并行化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全同态加密要求程序表示为布尔或算术电路，这比高级语言编程更繁琐。现有转译器支持的语言有限，需要扩展支持Haskell语言。

Method: 创建Haskell到布尔电路的转译器，并实现电路层的并行化评估器。

Result: 在私有信息检索和AES加密标准上验证了方法有效性。16线程下评估时间28秒，100线程下8秒。自动并行化方法在某些情况下优于手动并行化。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了面向FHE的高级语言范围，实现了有效的自动电路并行化，为FHE应用开发提供了更便捷的工具。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the evaluation of programs
directly on encrypted data. However, because only basic operations can be
performed on ciphertexts, programs must be expressed as boolean or arithmetic
circuits. This low-level representation makes implementing applications for FHE
significantly more cumbersome than writing code in a high-level language. To
reduce this burden, several transpilers have been developed that translate
high-level code into circuit representations. In this work, we extend the range
of high-level languages that can target FHE by introducing a transpiler for
Haskell, which converts Haskell programs into Boolean circuits suitable for
homomorphic evaluation. Our second contribution is the automatic
parallelization of these generated circuits. We implement an evaluator that
executes gates in parallel by parallelizing each layer of the circuit. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two key applications: Private
Information Retrieval (PIR) and the AES encryption standard. Prior work has
parallelized AES encryption manually. We demonstrate that the automated method
outperforms some but not all manual parallelizations of AES evaluations under
FHE. We achieve an evaluation time of 28 seconds for a parallel execution with
16 threads and an evaluation time of 8 seconds for a parallel execution with
100 threads

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于零知识证明的SSO认证机制，集成OIDC标准，保护用户隐私，防止身份提供商跟踪用户活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化SSO系统（如OIDC）无法保证用户隐私，身份提供商可以跟踪用户活动。需要一种机制让用户通过SSO认证而不泄露服务提供商信息。

Method: 利用Groth的zk-SNARK技术证明用户对已订阅服务提供商的成员资格，而不暴露其身份。采用去中心化和可验证的方法设置系统前提条件。

Result: 实现了高安全目标，同时保持最小的存储和延迟成本，证明该研究可用于生产环境。

Conclusion: 提出的零知识证明机制成功解决了SSO中的隐私问题，在保护用户隐私的同时保持了系统的实用性和性能。

Abstract: User authentication is one of the most important aspects for secure
communication between services and end-users over the Internet. Service
providers leverage Single-Sign On (SSO) to make it easier for their users to
authenticate themselves. However, standardized systems for SSO, such as OIDC,
do not guarantee user privacy as identity providers can track user activities.
We propose a zero-knowledge-based mechanism that integrates with OIDC to let
users authenticate through SSO without revealing information about the service
provider. Our system leverages Groth's zk-SNARK to prove membership of
subscribed service providers without revealing their identity. We adopt a
decentralized and verifiable approach to set up the prerequisites of our
construction that further secures and establishes trust in the system. We set
up high security targets and achieve them with minimal storage and latency
cost, proving that our research can be adopted for production.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有溯源收集系统存在"超级生产者威胁"，即溯源数据生成可能过载系统，导致安全相关事件被丢弃，攻击者可以隐藏其行为。资源隔离方法无法完全解决硬件依赖和性能限制问题。

Method: 利用操作系统内核调度器缓解该威胁，提出Venus学习型调度器，使用强化学习学习溯源任务行为并动态优化资源分配。

Result: Venus显著提高了溯源收集系统的完整性和效率，与传统调度相比保持合理开销，在某些情况下甚至比默认Linux调度器提高了整体运行时间。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的内核调度器Venus能够有效解决溯源系统中的超级生产者威胁，确保溯源数据的完整性，同时保持系统性能。

Abstract: Provenance plays a critical role in maintaining traceability of a system's
actions for root cause analysis of security threats and impacts. Provenance
collection is often incorporated into the reference monitor of systems to
ensure that an audit trail exists of all events, that events are completely
captured, and that logging of such events cannot be bypassed. However, recent
research has questioned whether existing state-of-the-art provenance collection
systems fail to ensure the security guarantees of a true reference monitor due
to the 'super producer threat' in which provenance generation can overload a
system to force the system to drop security-relevant events and allow an
attacker to hide their actions. One approach towards solving this threat is to
enforce resource isolation, but that does not fully solve the problems
resulting from hardware dependencies and performance limitations.
  In this paper, we show how an operating system's kernel scheduler can
mitigate this threat, and we introduce Venus, a learned scheduler for Linux
specifically designed for provenance. Unlike conventional schedulers that
ignore provenance completeness requirements, Venus leverages reinforcement
learning to learn provenance task behavior and to dynamically optimize resource
allocation. We evaluate Venus's efficacy and show that Venus significantly
improves both the completeness and efficiency of provenance collection systems
compared to traditional scheduling, while maintaining reasonable overheads and
even improving overall runtime in certain cases compared to the default Linux
scheduler.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在量子计算时代下，如何将后量子密码学与人工智能结合，为交通信息物理系统提供抗量子攻击的网络安全通信策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，传统密码学方法面临严重威胁，而交通信息物理系统高度依赖安全通信。需要开发能够抵御量子攻击的新型安全解决方案。

Method: 通过人工智能优化后量子密码学的算法选择、资源分配和实时威胁适应，将AI驱动的PQC方法集成到TCPS通信协议中。

Result: 提出了结合AI和PQC的网络安全通信策略，能够在量子计算时代为TCPS提供更高效、更有效的安全保护，同时不损害系统性能。

Conclusion: AI增强的后量子密码学是确保交通信息物理系统在量子时代保持安全通信的关键技术，能够提供抗量子攻击的弹性通信解决方案。

Abstract: Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) integrate physical elements,
such as transportation infrastructure and vehicles, with cyber elements via
advanced communication technologies, allowing them to interact seamlessly. This
integration enhances the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of
transportation systems. TCPS rely heavily on cryptographic security to protect
sensitive information transmitted between vehicles, transportation
infrastructure, and other entities within the transportation ecosystem,
ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. Traditional
cryptographic methods have been employed to secure TCPS communications, but the
advent of quantum computing presents a significant threat to these existing
security measures. Therefore, integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into
TCPS is essential to maintain secure and resilient communications. While PQC
offers a promising approach to developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to
quantum attacks, artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance PQC by optimizing
algorithm selection, resource allocation, and adapting to evolving threats in
real-time. AI-driven PQC approaches can improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of PQC implementations, ensuring robust security without
compromising system performance. This chapter introduces TCPS communication
protocols, discusses the vulnerabilities of corresponding communications to
cyber-attacks, and explores the limitations of existing cryptographic methods
in the quantum era. By examining how AI can strengthen PQC solutions, the
chapter presents cyber-resilient communication strategies for TCPS.

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护机制减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模经验模型与形式验证之间的鸿沟，减少语言模型生成中的幻觉问题，同时不牺牲生成效率。

Method: 基于概率程序语义的约束语义学，在解码时使用语义防护网格，结合贪心选择算法和知识感知安全质量量化事实风险。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，TAD 防护机制能有效减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量性能。

Conclusion: TAD 为大规模经验模型和形式验证之间提供了实用的桥梁，通过验证的解码方案实现了知识对齐的神经语言生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于大语言模型和多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转化为上下文状态表示，使智能体能够推理攻击者意图，并结合MAPPO算法学习复杂协作策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网的普及使关键网络物理系统面临复杂多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏上下文感知能力，难以有效应对。

Method: 融合LLM和MARL两种AI范式：使用LLM作为语义桥梁转换遥测数据为上下文状态表示，采用MAPPO多智能体强化学习算法学习协作策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作需求。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK ICS框架的合成数据集上测试，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，在保持物理过程稳定性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式，显著优于传统IDS、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体RL基线。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

TL;DR: 思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制来实现性能提升，而非学习全新能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型为何优于基础模型，明确其是学习新推理能力还是重新利用已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型方法，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法来发现可解释的推理行为。

Result: 在三个基础模型和四个思考模型上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时机高效部署这些机制。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例展示生成式AI如何解决神经心理学容量限制，实现个性化和纵向护理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化、连续的护理方法。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为个性化护理框架。

Result: AI能够实现连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样，动态适应个体需求和变化条件，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 心理健康数字孪生作为变革性框架，能够捕捉个体症状动态和轨迹，需要进一步研究来完善和实施这一框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力，需要更灵活、适应性的多智能体框架。

Method: 采用分层架构，由管理者智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重新规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和符合人类价值观的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空交通预测框架，通过引入新的SpatioSemantic专家，将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合，显著提升了预测性能。研究发现战略性的专家选择比复杂的多专家集成更有效，在减少推理延迟的同时达到了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的交通预测方法如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。需要开发能够同时考虑物理拓扑和数据驱动特征的增强框架。

Method: 提出了TESTAM+框架，引入SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合。采用战略性专家选择而非朴素集成聚合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%(3.10 vs 3.14)，在PEMS BAY上提升4.1%(1.65 vs 1.72)。最优的Identity + Adaptive配置在METR LA上比MegaCRN降低11.5% MAE(2.99 vs 3.38)，推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少但战略性设计的专家比复杂的多专家集成表现更好，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的性能，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统虽然能自动化复杂软件任务，但由于错误会在阶段间静默传递而难以信任，需要建立可追踪和可问责的管道系统。

Method: 采用Planner -> Executor -> Critic三阶段管道，评估了8种配置的三种最先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化问责交接显著提高准确性；不同模型在特定角色上有明确优势；准确度-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测且可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，存在幻觉和知识泄漏问题，需要一种能够充分利用LLM推理能力同时避免这些缺陷的方法。

Method: 设计TS-Agent代理，让LLM专注于证据收集和推理合成，将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，并采用自我批评和质量门控机制迭代优化推理。

Result: 在基准测试中，TS-Agent在理解任务上达到SOTA LLM水平，在推理任务上显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过分离LLM推理与时间序列分析，避免了多模态对齐训练，保持了时间序列的原始形式，确保了可解释性和可验证性，有效缓解了知识泄漏和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: LLMs可作为业务流程设计师和用户的有价值助手，具备深度推理能力，显示出类人化特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，可以应用于地理空间问题。

Method: 采用两阶段管道：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段具有优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Result: 实证研究表明身份偏见普遍存在，其中奉承偏见比自我偏见更为常见。响应匿名化方法能有效减少偏见，确保辩论基于内容而非来源身份。

Conclusion: 在多智能体辩论系统中"掩盖"身份是必要的，以确保推理基于内容而非来源身份，从而提高辩论的可靠性。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但经常因为边缘级错误级联（微小错误在消息传递中传播）而表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：(i)从失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销（延迟和额外成本均低于5%），接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，还贡献了边缘级错误的分类原则和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，但研究发现这主要是由于现有评估指标的系统性低估，需要更准确的评估方法和性能提升技术。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过人类估计性能，在16个数据集变体上TTM持续提升模型性能，相对增益高达85.7%。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时匹配算法，可以显著释放AI模型的隐藏组合推理能力，推动组合推理前沿的发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Motivation: 现实推荐系统中频繁添加新物品，现有离线策略学习方法在新物品存在时可能不安全，需要开发能保证安全性的探索框架

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关安全OPL方法），然后提出DEPL框架（利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化）

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时实现新物品的有效探索

Conclusion: 提出的DEPL框架能够解决安全性和探索性之间的权衡，确保推荐系统的安全实施同时探索新物品

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使智能体能够在丰富环境中自主行动并追求目标，但它们在跨模态的安全性、连贯性和信任推理能力仍然有限，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 引入可复现的仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知能力，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示智能体能够检测直接的多模态矛盾，但仅55%成功修正不安全计划。三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，45%的不安全行为因过度信任图像而被接受，该框架为研究多模态安全、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Conclusion: 基于在线因果语义的STL引导强化学习方法为深度强化学习提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严格基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，为自动化综述生成提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是构建可信、透明且经济高效的AI系统的重要进展，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功地将测试时图域适应问题重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM的能力在无需源域数据的情况下实现有效的域适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACONIC框架通过将任务建模为约束问题并利用形式复杂度度量来指导分解，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分解方法基于启发式或人工分解，导致LLM在复杂任务上可靠性不足，需要系统性的分解框架。

Method: 提出ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，使用形式复杂度度量来指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合优化任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，基于复杂度度量的分解使智能体性能提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过系统性的约束引导分解，有效解决了LLM在复杂任务上的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GCPO方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来改进强化学习训练，解决了GRPO算法在样本全对或全错时无法有效学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在局限性：模型的rollout响应上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全对或全错的样本中获取知识。

Method: 引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法能充分利用每个样本提高训练效率，并让模型在训练中学习参考答案的解题策略，增强推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了SHADOW框架，用于在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与暴露风险的策略决策，通过强化学习同时学习移动和通信策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在对抗环境中，智能体需要在获取信息增强态势感知与避免暴露自身位置之间的关键权衡问题。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈框架和SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追击者在成功率上优于六个竞争基线，消融研究确认时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于LLM的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配和局部导航代理的协同优化，在城市级路网中显著提升交通效率和缓解拥堵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市级网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理协调区域间交通流分布，以及局部导航代理生成符合全局指令的自适应路线，采用双奖励结构的协同推理优化机制。

Result: 在四个真实路网（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在9个经典路径搜索和RL基线方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市级交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

TL;DR: Augur是一个完全基于LLM的时间序列预测框架，利用LLM的因果推理能力发现变量间的有向因果关系，通过师生架构实现准确且可解释的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示和缺乏可解释性等局限性，需要更有效的LLM驱动解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验推断有向因果图；学生代理精炼因果图，并对高置信度因果关联进行微调，将其编码为丰富文本提示进行预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur实现了竞争性性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，在提高预测准确性的同时提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，展示了LLM在时间序列预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以全面衡量DeepResearch系统的整体研究能力，这些系统需要整合多种来源、生成见解并呈现连贯发现，这些能力难以通过传统基准测试验证。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，构建包含100个查询的标准化基准，涵盖12个现实世界类别，系统评估研究报告的质量、冗余性和事实性。

Result: 评估了四个领先商业系统，揭示了不同的设计理念和性能权衡，为DeepResearch从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的演进提供了基础见解。

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval框架为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面有效的解决方案，填补了现有评估方法的空白，支持系统性能力比较。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI透明度实践过于技术化，难以让公众理解，无法连接理解与行动潜力，且未能揭示决策的广泛社会物质背景。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义透明度的概念框架，强调透明度应让公众能够参与影响其生活的AI系统，将理解与行动潜力连接起来。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决AI系统在政府服务中偏见和减少公民机构问题的关键原则，需要超越技术对象，关注公众参与和行动能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FactFin框架来解决LLM金融代理中的信息泄漏问题，通过反事实扰动迫使模型学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果，并在FinLake-Bench基准测试中表现出优越的样本外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理存在'利润幻象'问题，即回测收益在模型知识窗口结束后迅速消失，这源于LLM中的固有信息泄漏。

Method: FactFin框架包含四个核心组件：策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器，通过反事实扰动强制模型学习因果驱动因素。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在所有基线方法中表现出最佳的样本外泛化能力，提供了优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理中的信息泄漏问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和实际交易表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI代理控制单元的方法在提供个性化交互方面存在局限，检索增强生成虽然提升了上下文感知，但缺乏将上下文信息与用户特定数据结合的机制。

Method: 基于统一个性化定义构建技术需求，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore等指标，并通过为期五天的试点用户研究获得了关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供了早期指导，突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM代理的自适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Result: 在真实搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法，同时提升了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架通过步进奖励优化和多样化学习策略，有效解决了电商搜索相关性分析中的关键挑战，为AI驱动的电商搜索提供了更可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench基准暴露了现有语音语言模型在真实代理场景中的不足，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI智能体在模糊、动态变化和冲突任务场景中的信息困境问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI智能体过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户参与的必要性，导致在信息困境场景中无法适应真实用户需求和偏好。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含信息管理智能体（负责槽位信息管理和主动用户交互）、决策智能体（冲突感知规划）和反思智能体（任务反思和信息一致性验证），围绕共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，ReInAgent比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率，能更有效地解决信息困境并产生更符合用户偏好的结果。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的用户-智能体协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，在复杂现实场景中实现了更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值嵌入空间中的表现。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，表明许多嵌入空间分量与数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会下降。

Conclusion: 语言模型在数值表示中存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR通过基于推理阶段熵的奖励机制，在保持准确性的同时有效缩短大型推理模型的响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理过程往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，基于不同推理阶段的熵值设计奖励：在思考阶段惩罚过高熵值，在答案阶段允许适度探索，从而鼓励生成简洁但有效的推理过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确率，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR提供了一种无需显式长度目标或严格截断规则的自适应长度控制方法，通过阶段熵感知的奖励设计平衡简洁性和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能欠佳和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示相对稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保持任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保留通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业角色，提升了微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: 通过考虑注意力参数的功能差异，AILoRA在保持参数效率的同时，显著改进了LoRA的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言转换为逼真的交互式3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡命令遵循准确性和真实世界驾驶环境真实性方面存在困难，通常通过限制场景为2D或开放循环模拟来降低复杂性，从而牺牲了真实性。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言和闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的具有不同关键性的场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），精炼模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力，成功弥合了自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学和大语言模型对齐等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有的符合选择方法仅限于单阈值场景，无法满足多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，针对合取条件引入了具有区域单调性的新非符合性分数，针对析取条件使用了全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序，建立了具有理论保证的有限样本FDR控制。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，其在多样条件组合、不同现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS算法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，解决了现有方法在多条件场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，在电商平台评论质量评估中验证有效，提升用户浏览量和转化率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域相关且动态的概念。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: 提出AutoQual框架，模拟人类研究过程：通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，在持久内存中积累经验。该框架将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算的特征。

Result: 在拥有亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，大规模A/B测试显示：平均每用户浏览评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提升0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估中的领域适应性和可解释性问题，证明了将LLM用于自动特征发现的可行性，为其他领域提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理变量来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理变量对AI决策的影响，需要一种数学上可证明的公平性保证方法。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理变量，构建捕获偏见模式完整结构的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法生成了与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性，保证了真正的独立性而不仅仅是去相关。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个可认证和数学基础的方法，确保在贷款审批等任务中的完全公平性，其中ZIP代码等代理变量可能揭示种族信息。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止无意中引导用户做出风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究语言模型在不同经济场景下复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索和对话响应来解决开放域对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两难选择：轻量级指令模型延迟低但推理深度不足，工具增强的ReAct代理通过外部知识提高准确性但同步执行导致检索过程中交互阻塞。

Method: PMFR采用三组件架构：知识充足性评估器实时评估知识充分性，轻量级响应生成器提供即时交互，异步知识精炼代理在后台增强知识。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（23.38秒→1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了开放域对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持了高质量的响应。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含相互依赖问题的长视野推理基准，并使用强化学习与验证奖励进行训练。

Result: 评估发现最先进的推理模型在长视野推理中性能显著下降，存在有效推理长度有限和思考预算分配不当的问题。使用R-HORIZON数据进行强化学习训练，不仅提升了多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提高了7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Conclusion: 该指数旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，并为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Result: 该方法确保设计一致性，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2降至m个参数，且与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度。

Conclusion: TTM是有效的偏好建模方法，显著降低认知负担和计算复杂度，已开发基于Web的工具证明其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过干预学习因果结构的方法DODO有效，能显著提升因果图重构精度，为AI因果理解提供可行路径

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现长期控制，攻击成功率接近100%且误触发率接近0，同时还能提升智能体在良性任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发了严重担忧，需要揭示这些智能体存在的安全漏洞。

Method: CoTri后门攻击采用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控，使智能体偏离预定任务。

Result: 实验显示CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率，同时误触发率接近零。由于训练数据建模了环境的随机性，植入CoTri反而增强了智能体在良性任务上的性能和对环境干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri能够在智能体中实现稳定的多步控制，同时提升其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在三个核心维度面临的挑战：互操作性、交互协作和知识共享，为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供基础。

Method: 设计了三层协议：HAI（人机交互协议）标准化信息流，UAP（统一代理协议）实现异构代理互联，MEK（记忆提取知识协议）建立认知链实现知识共享。

Conclusion: Co-TAP协议框架为构建高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供了坚实的工程基础和理论指导。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了大型语言模型在推理过程中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。作者提出了一种问题感知的早停方法，通过动态截断反思来减少推理token数量，在准确率下降较小的情况下显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中反思行为对性能提升的实际贡献，探索如何在不显著影响准确率的情况下提高推理效率。

Method: 系统分析八个推理模型在五个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的SFT数据集进行训练，并提出问题感知的早停方法动态截断反思。

Result: 反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步数主要提升首次答案正确性；提出的早停方法减少24.5%推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思行为对性能提升的贡献有限，通过动态截断反思可以在保持较高准确率的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的能力边界，避免因大量采样导致的随机猜测偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中发现RLVR模型在小k值时优于基础模型，但在大k值时基础模型反而表现更好，这被解释为基础模型具有更大的推理边界。作者认为在离散答案空间任务中，大k值下的Pass@k反映的是随机猜测成功概率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型能够解决的问题中至少有tau比例补全正确的比例。该指标通过显式可靠性阈值来捕捉推理能力，随机猜测的模型在tau增加时会迅速退化。

Result: 使用Cover@tau指标评估多个RLVR模型，发现与Pass@1相比，流行算法的相对排名发生了变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau提供了一个更可靠的评估框架，能够区分真实推理能力和随机猜测，为模型能力评估提供了更准确的度量标准。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏差和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者时直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: 语义相似度评分方法：从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将文本映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到人类重测信度的90%，保持现实的响应分布，并提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务中表现出色，可作为即插即用模块在实际部署中使用。

Conclusion: QAgent框架通过代理式检索有效解决了传统RAG的局限性，提升了LLM在知识密集型任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 为LLM真实性检测提供了新的范式，结合理论优雅性和实践效率，证明了同时量化内部和外部不确定性的必要性。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

Motivation: 传统LLM在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中表现有限，因为它们缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有MLE方法的知识传递受限，无法充分利用历史轨迹或跨分支共享信息。

Method: 提出AutoMLGen，集成领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自进化和协作学习。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过结合领域知识库和MCGS搜索策略，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的性能，证明了其在复杂MLE场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中策略性地收集相关信息，然后才执行任务。策略性信息收集要求模型不仅知道如何有效获取信息，还要知道何时停止收集并做出决策，以避免过度思考或偏离正轨。

Method: CaRT通过反事实轨迹对微调LLMs：一个轨迹在适当时候终止，另一个是相同轨迹的轻微修改版本但不应终止。模型通过语言推理解释终止决策的合理性，并将这种能力通过微调注入基础LLM。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs何时停止寻求信息，通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练，显著提升了策略性信息收集的性能。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
