In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model.

Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL).

Our demo\nvideo is available at https://youtu.be/8VWZXpERR18"}

Traditional\nsupervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data,\nwhich is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel\napproach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning\nto iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for\nlabels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs\nwhile improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn\nwith minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present\na comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based\nanomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop\nprogressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on\nreal-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent\nComputing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\\% of the data.\nThe datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux,\nBSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios. The results show\nsubstantial improvements in detection rates during active learning,\noutperforming existing methods."}

The methodology integrates Vehicle Signal Specification\nmodeling to standardize vehicle signal definitions, improve compatibility\nacross automotive subsystems, and streamline integration with third-party\ntesting tools. Generated test cases are executed within the digital.auto\nplayground, an open and vendor-neutral environment designed to facilitate rapid\nvalidation of software-defined vehicle functionalities. We evaluate our\napproach using the Child Presence Detection System use case, demonstrating\nsubstantial reductions in manual test specification effort and rapid execution\nof generated tests. Despite significant automation, the generation of test\ncases and test scripts still requires manual intervention due to current\nlimitations in the GenAI pipeline and constraints of the digital.auto platform."}

Traditional approaches primarily\nfocus on code coverage and load testing, but often fall short of capturing\ncomplex user behaviors, leaving many usability issues undetected. The emergence\nof large language models (LLM) and AI agents opens new possibilities for web\ntesting by enabling human-like interaction with websites and a general\nawareness of common usability problems. In this work, we present WebProber, a\nprototype AI agent-based web testing framework. Given a URL, WebProber\nautonomously explores the website, simulating real user interactions,\nidentifying bugs and usability issues, and producing a human-readable report.\nWe evaluate WebProber through a case study of 120 academic personal websites,\nwhere it uncovered 29 usability issues--many of which were missed by\ntraditional tools. Our findings highlight agent-based testing as a promising\ndirection while outlining directions for developing next-generation,\nuser-centered testing frameworks."}
