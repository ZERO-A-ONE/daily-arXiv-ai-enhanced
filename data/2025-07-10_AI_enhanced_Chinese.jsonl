While research has\nidentified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a\nneed for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice.\nObjective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative\nimportance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the\nchallenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes.\nMethod: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the\nquality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a\nsampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous\nsample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We\ncollected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We\nfound that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability,\nMaintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality\nattributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most\ndivergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the\nsoftware-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the\nimportant attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics,\nlack of an established review process, and lack of external support.\nConclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further\nsupport with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under\ndifferent software testing contexts. The findings can serve as a guideline for\nacademic researchers when looking for research directions on the topic.

ITSs also support internal linking\nbetween issues, and external linking to other tools and information sources.\nThis provides SE organisations key forms of documentation, including forwards\nand backwards traceability (e.g., Feature Requests linked to sprint releases\nand code commits linked to Bug Reports). An Issue Tracking Ecosystem (ITE) is\nthe aggregate of the central ITS and the related SE artefacts, stakeholders,\nand processes -- with an emphasis on how these contextual factors interact with\nthe ITS. The quality of ITEs is central to the success of these organisations\nand their software products. There are challenges, however, within ITEs,\nincluding complex networks of interlinked artefacts and diverse workflows.\nWhile ITSs have been the subject of study in SE research for decades, ITEs as a\nwhole need further exploration.\n  In this thesis, I undertake the challenge of understanding ITEs at a broader\nlevel, addressing these questions regarding complexity and diversity. I\ninterviewed practitioners and performed archival analysis on a diverse set of\nITSs. These analyses revealed the context-dependent nature of ITE problems,\nhighlighting the need for context-specific ITE research. While previous work\nhas produced many solutions to specific ITS problems, these solutions are not\nconsistently framed in a context-rich and comparable way, leading to a desire\nfor more aligned solutions across research and practice.

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course.

Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts,\nso complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating\nand executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a\ndeveloper's modified version, but fails again after merging with another\ndeveloper's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective\nat detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly\ndue to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and\nEvosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome\nthese limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on\nCode Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests\nusing different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter\nconfigurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler\nsystems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex,\nreal-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in\ndetecting conflicts. Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation\nremains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there\nis promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.\n  --\n  Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\\c{c}as em\numa base de c\\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de\naltera\\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores. Ferramentas\ntradicionais de merge n~ao conseguem detectar esse tipo de conflito, por isso\nferramentas complementares como o SMAT foram propostas. O SMAT depende da\ngera\\c{c}~ao e execu\\c{c}~ao de testes de unidade: se um teste falha na vers~ao\nbase, passa na vers~ao modificada por um desenvolvedor, mas volta a falhar\nap\\'os o merge com as mudan\\c{c}as de outro desenvolvedor, um conflito\nsem^antico \\'e identificado.

This\npaper extends and simplifies this formalization using a modal logic defined by\na Kripke structure, to explicitly include time. The RTS defined in the AADL\nstandard are also expanded to support reactive state-transition machines of the\nBehavior Specification annex standard language (BA) and its closely-related,\nformally-defined counterpart, the Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with\nSoftware (BLESS). An example of AADL RTS with time, implemented by the High\nAssurance Modeling and Rapid Engineering for Embedded Systems (HAMR) for\nstate-transition machine behavior written in BLESS, is also presented.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86AADL\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86RTS\u4ee5\u652f\u6301BA\u548cBLESS\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "AADL\u6807\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e14RTS\u9700\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Kripke\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u6269\u5c55AADL\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55RTS\u4ee5\u652f\u6301BA\u548cBLESS\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684AADL RTS\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7HAMR\u5de5\u5177\u5c55\u793a\u4e86BLESS\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u7684AADL\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u548cRTS\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

CTI involves\ncollecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate\nand rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data,\nautomation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nmodels is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems\nleverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks,\nforums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior\nresearch has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study\nexpands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of\nthe entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks.

In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to\nrate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher\nscores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'\nprobability of giving a misaligned answer.

As\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical\napplications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only\nexplicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly\naccessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through\nelaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such\nmethods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially\nconstraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C\nPrompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive\ncomponents: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration.

Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing\nSpattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven\nrepresentative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSpattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific\nuser subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when\nonly 0.1\\% of users are malicious.

A specific use case utilizing Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)-related data demonstrates the framework's\napplicability and implementation in real-world scenarios, such as in the\ntelecommunications industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTELSAFE\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e13\u5bb6\u610f\u89c1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u5982\u7535\u4fe1\u884c\u4e1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTELSAFE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7CVE\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7528\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "TELSAFE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002"}}

Initially, we introduce the\ndevelopment, fundamentals, and backgrounds of AN. Subsequently, we highlight a\ncomprehensive survey of the current state of research on various AN-empowered\nscenarios and AN-combined technologies. Finally, we discuss some technical\nchallenges to tackle for AN-aided wireless security in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\uff08AN\uff09\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0cAN\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5408\u6cd5\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u7a83\u542c\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u7814\u4e86AN\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u9700\u89e3\u51b3AN\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Edge-local differential privacy\n(edge-LDP) and shuffle model have been employed to achieve subgraph counting\nunder a privacy-preserving situation. Existing algorithms are plagued by high\ntime complexity, excessive download costs, low accuracy, or dependence on\ntrusted third parties. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the\nNoisy Adjacency Matrix (NAM), which combines differential privacy with the\nadjacency matrix of the graph. NAM offers strong versatility and scalability,\nmaking it applicable to a wider range of DP variants, DP mechanisms, and graph\ntypes. Based on NAM, we designed five algorithms (TriOR, TriTR, TriMTR, QuaTR,\nand 2STAR) to count three types of subgraphs: triangles, quadrangles, and\n2-stars. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that in triangle\ncounting, TriOR maximizes accuracy with reduced time complexity among one-round\nalgorithms, TriTR achieves optimal accuracy, TriMTR achieves the highest\naccuracy under low download costs, and QuaTR stands as the first quadrangle\ncounting algorithm under pure edge-LDP. We implement edge-LDP for noisy data\nvia a confidence interval-inspired method, providing DP guarantees on\nrandomized data. Our 2STAR algorithm achieves the highest accuracy in 2-star\ncounting and can be derived as a byproduct of two-round triangle or quadrangle\ncounting algorithms, enabling efficient joint estimation of triangle,\nquadrangle, and 2-star counts within two query rounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNAM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b50\u56fe\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u56fe\u8ba1\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Noisy Adjacency Matrix (NAM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08TriOR\u3001TriTR\u3001TriMTR\u3001QuaTR\u548c2STAR\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u3001\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u548c2-\u661f\u5b50\u56fe\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u8ba1\u6570\u4e2d\uff0cTriOR\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u4f4e\uff0cTriTR\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u4f18\uff0cTriMTR\u5728\u4f4e\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cQuaTR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7eafedge-LDP\u4e0b\u7684\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u8ba1\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u30022STAR\u57282-\u661f\u8ba1\u6570\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "NAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b50\u56fe\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Therefore, they reverse engineer a benign binary and inject\nmalicious code into it. This obfuscation technique circumvents the malware\ndetection models and deceives the ML classifiers due to the prevalence of\nbenign features compared to malicious features. However, extracting the\nfeatures from the potential malicious regions enhances the accuracy and\ndecreases false positives. Hence, we propose a novel model named\nPotentRegion4MalDetect that extracts features from the potential malicious\nregions. PotentRegion4MalDetect determines the nodes with potential\nmaliciousness in the partially preprocessed Control Flow Graph (CFG) using the\nmalicious strings given by StringSifter. Then, it extracts advanced features of\nthe identified potential malicious regions alongside the features from the\ncompletely preprocessed CFG. The features extracted from the completely\npreprocessed CFG mitigate obfuscation techniques that attempt to disguise\nmalicious content, such as suspicious strings. The experiments reveal that the\nPotentRegion4MalDetect requires fewer entries to save the features for all\nbinaries than the model focusing on the entire binary, reducing memory\noverhead, faster computation, and lower storage requirements. These advanced\nfeatures give an 8.13% increase in SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)\nAbsolute Mean and a 1.44% increase in SHAP Beeswarm value compared to those\nextracted from the entire binary.

These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories.
