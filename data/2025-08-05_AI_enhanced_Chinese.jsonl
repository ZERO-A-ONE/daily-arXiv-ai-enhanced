Through a year-long\ncollaboration with Ericsson Montr\\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine\nLearning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to\ntrace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation\nneeds, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into\nactionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting\nautomated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the\nExcellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when\nconflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL\naddresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in\ninterfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental\nadoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's\nintegration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed\nconsistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and\ntrust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer\nsemi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative\nfeedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review.

To address this, we\nintroduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that\nautomatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs\nwhile maintaining industrial efficiency requirements.

Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly)\nproduce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar)\nhave a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work\naddresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach\n(called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from\nexisting inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a\ntesting goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input\ndistribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic\ngrammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code\ncoverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long\nexecution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats\n(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,\nFdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based\ntest generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),\nEvoGFuzz and DynaMosa.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design.

As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated\nexperimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk\nof losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases.

Existing\nbenchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or\nsimple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better\nevaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm\nconsists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling\nfirewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service\nattacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and\nrule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these\ntasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We\nevaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude\nSonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.\nSurprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these\nfrontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate\n(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these\nmodels are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in\nchatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading\nagentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it\nalso amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from\nalignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to\nmonitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is\nsignificantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,\nwith average detection accuracy at only 72%.

While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an\niterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating\noutputs through execution or semantic reasoning.

In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag\non dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to\nsandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware.

Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs\non the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms\nof high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5AdVAR-DNN\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0fDNN\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0fDNN\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u6362\u5206\u533a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VAE\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AdVAR-DNN\u7684\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "AdVAR-DNN\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss\nfunction calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while\nlearning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION\ndataset are designed to evaluate H2C.

Accordingly, in addition to\napplying existing software engineering knowledge, it is becoming increasingly\nimportant to evolve software engineering tailored specifically to dialogue\nsystems. In this paper, we enumerate the knowledge areas of dialogue systems\nengineering based on those of software engineering, as defined in the Software\nEngineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Version 4.0, and survey each area. Based\non this survey, we identify unexplored topics in each area and discuss the\nfuture direction of dialogue systems engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u79f0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u67e5\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u663e\u8457\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u6b63\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8eSWEBOK 4.0\u5217\u4e3e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSWEBOK 4.0\u5217\u4e3e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u67e5\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5404\u9886\u57df\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark\ndesigned to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of\nthree subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or\nall modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER\nreveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on\naudio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual\nmodality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient\nframework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two\nmodules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism\nthat reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention\nreallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen\nbackbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it\nmitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent\nsamples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.\nExperiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our\nCA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nparticularly under modality conflict conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCA-MER\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cMoSEAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoSEAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bMoSE\uff08\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u548cAR\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "MoSEAR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u51b2\u7a81\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "MoSEAR\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Although introducing TPLs by clones\nis prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.\nAlso, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is\nproblematic.

To evaluate the\nefficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as\nreference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects.

Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven\nmulti-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure\ncommunication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or\nadversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of\nthese emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies\ncannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the\nfirst unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable\nand agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts\ndecentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent\nauthentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,\nand smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control\npolicies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message\nauthenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across\nagent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine\n(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including\nByzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission\nrevocation.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes.

Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image\ngeneration, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable\ndiagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary\nchallenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the\nstructural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram\ngeneration. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent\nsystem designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into\nstructured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic\nreasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and\nstructurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual\neffort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the\nSketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework\nencompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed\ngraphs, and model architectures.

As NFTs are traded as digital assets,\nthey have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of\nNFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to\nsubstantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper\npresents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect\npotential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies\nfour common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721\nReentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying\nexclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a\nhigh false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates\nstatic analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM\nemploys static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow\ninformation from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and\nControl Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with\nvectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the\nknowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the\nanalyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.\nFinally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection\ncapabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of\npotential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed\n8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,\na recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)\nframework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.\nThe key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning\nprocess by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with\nstronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.\nSpecifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or\nlocal knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we\nemploy Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of\nreasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the\nincorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire\nthe capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long\ncontexts.

Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be\ndifferent approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the\nproblem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw\nacross the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex\nmodel. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data\nbehaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine.

To address this issue, we present daleq, a tool that\ndisassembles Java byte code into a relational database, and can normalise this\ndatabase by applying datalog rules. Those databases can then be used to infer\nequivalence between two classes. Notably, equivalence statements are\naccompanied with datalog proofs recording the normalisation process. We\ndemonstrate the impact of daleq in an industrial context through a large-scale\nevaluation involving 2,714 pairs of jars, comprising 265,690 class pairs. In\nthis evaluation, daleq is compared to two existing bytecode transformation\ntools. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the manual effort\nrequired to assess non-bitwise equivalent artifacts, which would otherwise\ndemand intensive human inspection. Furthermore, the results show that daleq\noutperforms existing tools by identifying more artifacts rebuilt from the same\ncode as equivalent, even when no behavioral differences are present.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5de5\u5177daleq\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83Java\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u4ef6\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "method": "daleq\u5c06Java\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u53cd\u6c47\u7f16\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7datalog\u89c4\u5219\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cdaleq\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "daleq\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u4ef6\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, most\nof them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but\ngenerally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently\nhigh attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nBackdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense\neffectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned\ndata. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned\ndata, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small\nset of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is\ndesigned to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a\ncycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean\nand identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream\nattacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without\nsignificantly reducing the CACC.

While human feedback is essential for improving data\nquality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce\nRefine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as\nboth a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing\niterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate\nrefinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every\niteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human\nannotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response\nand judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.\nThis process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the\nrefinement, indicating no further improvements.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6216\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u89e6\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u53ca\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\uff09\uff0c\u51716500\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6216\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

We propose\nRouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the\ndesign of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific\nexperts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.\nTo capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two\ncomplementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the\nintensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),\ncharacterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each\nexpert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and\nlightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce\na similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between\na suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse\ntasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields\nhigh similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.\nMoreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert\nreplacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,\npruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.\nOur work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly\napplicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.", "AI": {"tldr": "RouteMark\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u6307\u7eb9\u4fdd\u62a4MoE\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8def\u7531\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u7eb9\u548c\u8def\u7531\u504f\u597d\u6307\u7eb9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5f52\u5c5e\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u6307\u7eb9\uff08RSF\u548cRPF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548cCLIP-based MoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0cRouteMark\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u62b5\u6297\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6027\u7be1\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "RouteMark\u4e3aMoE\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Specifically, the framework first generates an\ninitial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior\nbeliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It\nthen employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature\nevidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'\ntheorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information\nentropy $H = - \\sum {{p_i}\\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the\niterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and\nconfidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world\nresearch question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12\noptimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves\nby 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the\nframework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases\nsignificantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic\nreasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving\nthe quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6HypoAgents\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7206\u70b8\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u517c\u5177\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\u6216\u7eb3\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHypoAgents\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ICLR 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc712\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5e73\u5747ELO\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347116.3\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u771f\u5b9e\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\u57fa\u51c617.8\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u4f53\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e0.92\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We observed measurable impacts using GPU\ntelemetry (nvidia-smi) and Nsight Compute profiling, where frame rate dropped\nby 50 percent, and power usage increased by up to 90%. To detect, we trained\nlightweight classifiers using extracted telemetry features. All models achieved\nhigh accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To address this\nlimitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark\ncomprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to\nevaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and\nreproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate\nLiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and\n527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework\nthat enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task\nenvironments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose\nthe MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic\nplanning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool\nsuite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model\n(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate.

To avoid distortions in voice commands, we\ndesign a modular command generation model that parameterizes attack distance,\nvictim audio, and medium dispersion features to adapt to variations in the\nsolid-channel state. Additionally, we propose SUAD Defense, a universal defense\nthat uses ultrasonic perturbation signals to block inaudible voice attacks\n(IVAs) without impacting normal speech. Since the attack can occur at arbitrary\nfrequencies and times, we propose a training method that randomizes both time\nand frequency to generate perturbation signals that break ultrasonic commands.\nNotably, the perturbation signal is modulated to an inaudible frequency without\naffecting the functionality of voice commands for VAs.

While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first\nscalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating\nalignment failures at source.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues.

These were classified by a fine tuned LLM\ninto five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal,\nforming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key\ncontribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and\npractical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific\ndetails on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both\ndata extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel,\naccessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation\nsector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ea4\u901a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u884c\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e94\u79cd\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u901a\u4e13\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u884c\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination.

Our model is developed through\nself-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with\nexpert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers\nthree significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot\ngeneralisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and\nout-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control\npolicies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is\nlightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling\nlarge-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC\nprocess and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its\nself-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,\noutperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In\npractice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,\nshortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

Evaluation, Implications and Emerging Questions for Agentic E-Commerce", "comment": null, "summary": "Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on\nbehalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,\nvision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and\ntransact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?\nWe develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent\nwith a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first\nconduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by\nrandomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and\nplatform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually\nshop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top\nrow, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption\nof a universal \"top\" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward\nendorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally\nhuman-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios\nwhere sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a\nseller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI\nbuyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated\nshopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across\nmodels and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,\nraising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents\nmay behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,\nplatform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7535\u5546\u4e2d\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ACES\u6c99\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u6d4b\u8bd5VLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u7b49\u53cd\u5e94\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5356\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7535\u5546\u4e2d\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1ACES\u6c99\u76d2\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684VLM\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5316\u4ea7\u54c1\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u7b49\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8d2d\u7269\u53c2\u6570\u53cd\u5e94\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d5e\u52a9\u6807\u7b7e\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u5356\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u91cd\u5851\u7535\u5546\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5356\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Nevertheless,\ndiffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically\nsimilar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately\nimpairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for\ncomplex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO\n(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces\ndispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating\nall hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels\nthe network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,\nthereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences\nnecessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer\nregularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply\nenhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,\nD2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after\nfine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of\nreal-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high\nsuccess rate of our method.
