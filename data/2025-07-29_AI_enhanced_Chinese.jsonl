However, existing mechanisms overlook the\nmemorability demands on users for recovery, such as the need to recall a\nthreshold number of trustees. Therefore, we first formalize the notion of\nrecovery metadata in the context of social key recovery, illustrating the\ntradeoff between easing the burden of memorizing the metadata and maintaining\nmetadata privacy. We present Apollo, the first framework that addresses this\ntradeoff by distributing indistinguishable data within a user's social circle,\nwhere trustees hold relevant data and non-trustees store random data. Apollo\neliminates the need to memorize recovery metadata since a user eventually\ngathers sufficient data from her social circle for recovery. Due to\nindistinguishability, Apollo protects metadata privacy by forming an anonymity\nset that hides the trustees among non-trustees. To make the anonymity set\nscalable, Apollo proposes a novel multi-layered secret sharing scheme that\nmitigates the overhead due to the random data distributed among non-trustees.\nFinally, we provide a prototype implementation of Apollo and report on its\nperformance. Apollo reduces the chances of malicious recovery to between 0.005%\nand 1.8%, depending on the adversary's ability to compromise.

Although we observe a difference rate of\napproximately 10% between the Java specific tools and their generic\ncounterparts, most of the differences stem from implementation details and\ncould be avoided. We find that LastMerge reports 15% fewer false positives than\njDime while Mergiraf misses 42% fewer false negatives than Spork.

To address this gap, we investigate the impact of\nrefactoring and its propagation on six state-of-the-art JIT-DP approaches.

Our experiments reveal that failing to consider refactoring\ninformation in the dataset can diminish the performance of models, particularly\nsemantic-based models, by 18.6% and 37.3% in F1-score. Additionally, we propose\nintegrating refactoring information to enhance six baseline approaches,\nresulting in overall improvements in recall and F1-score, with increases of up\nto 43.2% and 32.5%, respectively.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

Healthcare is one of such domains\nwhere KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge\naccuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing\ngeneral factual information often lack the ability to account for important\ncontexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are\ncrucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics.

Integrated by the DeepSeek-V3 model,\nPrometheus resolves 28.67% and 13.7% of issues on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench\nMultilingual, respectively, with an average API cost of $0.23 and $0.38 per\nissue. Prometheus resolves 10 unique issues not addressed by prior work and is\nthe first to demonstrate effectiveness across seven programming languages.\nMoreover, it shows the ability to resolve real-world GitHub issues in the\nLangChain and OpenHands repositories.

Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated\nsub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore\ncannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world\npractice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also\nneglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow\nset of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this\npaper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique\nexpressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in\nthree phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts\nguide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all\ncontrol-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and\ncontext-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%).

When integrating such models into aeronautical\napplications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the\nmodel performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values.\nOften, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model\nperformance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an\nexample of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt\ncomponent (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first\ndescribes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior.

Previous studies\nreported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source\ndevelopment. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.\nThe state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing\npast migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent\nconfigurations across CI services.

Additionally, it demonstrated consistent\nimprovements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction\nimage parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.\nThis work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction\ninto structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical\nresearch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5176\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MLLM\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u56fe\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a80.8%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff0835.6%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While\nnumerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either\nby maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),\npractical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each\ntest reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and\nembodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what\nassertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly\npass code review and be integrated into the software product.\n  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific\ntests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is\nmotivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared\nto coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to\ntest; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that\ndomain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code\nand a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal\ncomment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the\nproject to guide test generation.

However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique.

To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we\nhave designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local\ninformation of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility\nresources).

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO).

This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge.

Our results show that prompt design\nsignificantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based\nevaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aevalSmarT\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u6ce8\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982BLEU\u548cROUGE\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86evalSmarT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea640\u79cdLLMs\u548c10\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301400\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u6ce8\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To analyze, we first elicit such failures by\nperforming a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize\ntest cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in\ndeterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we\nadopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware\nprompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without\nenumerating full action spaces.
