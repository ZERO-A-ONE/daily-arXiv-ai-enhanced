Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations.

However, the positive impact resulting from the\nhyperparameter tuning step may differ based on the targeted SDP scenario.\nComparing the impact of hyperparameter tuning across SDP scenarios is necessary\nto provide comprehensive insights and enhance the robustness, generalizability,\nand, eventually, the practicality of SDP modeling for quality assurance.\n  Therefore, in this study, we contrast the impact of hyperparameter tuning\nacross two pivotal and consecutive SDP scenarios: (1) Inner Version Defect\nPrediction (IVDP) and (2) Cross Version Defect Prediction (CVDP). The main\ndistinctions between the two scenarios lie in the scope of defect prediction\nand the selected evaluation setups. This study's experiments use common\nevaluation setups, 28 machine learning (ML) algorithms, 53 post-release\nsoftware datasets, two tuning algorithms, and five optimization metrics. We\napply statistical analytics to compare the SDP performance impact differences\nby investigating the overall impact, the single ML algorithm impact, and\nvariations across different software dataset sizes.\n  The results indicate that the SDP gains within the IVDP scenario are\nsignificantly larger than those within the CVDP scenario. The results reveal\nthat asserting performance gains for up to 24 out of 28 ML algorithms may not\nhold across multiple SDP scenarios. Furthermore, we found that small software\ndatasets are more susceptible to larger differences in performance impacts.\nOverall, the study findings recommend software engineering researchers and\npractitioners to consider the effect of the selected SDP scenario when\nexpecting performance gains from hyperparameter tuning."}

While existing research focuses on optimizing\nindividual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an\nunderexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this\ngap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three\nstate-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control\nstrategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a\nnovel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand.

We then show\nthat a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline,\nserves as a \"sweet spot\", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with\nminimal impact on solve rates.

Traditional deterministic schedules break down when\nreality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.\nThis thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with\nonline temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible\nunder worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible\njob-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\\Delta^*$ to\nobtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a\nSimple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic\ncontrollability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime\nactivities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or\ndeadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4\nbenchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\\% of deadline\nviolations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding\nonly 3--5\\% makespan overhead.

We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions.

An\nalternative approach is to fine-tune LLMs directly on edge devices using local\ndata; however, this introduces a new challenge: the model owner must transfer\nproprietary models to the edge, which risks intellectual property (IP) leakage.\nTo address this dilemma, we propose DistilLock, a TEE-assisted fine-tuning\nframework that enables privacy-preserving knowledge distillation on the edge.\nIn DistilLock, a proprietary foundation model is executed within a trusted\nexecution environment (TEE) enclave on the data owner's device, acting as a\nsecure black-box teacher. This setup preserves both data privacy and model IP\nby preventing direct access to model internals. Furthermore, DistilLock employs\na model obfuscation mechanism to offload obfuscated weights to untrusted\naccelerators for efficient knowledge distillation without compromising\nsecurity. We demonstrate that DistilLock prevents unauthorized knowledge\ndistillation processes and model-stealing attacks while maintaining high\ncomputational efficiency, but offering a secure and practical solution for\nedge-based LLM personalization."}

The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest\nincrease in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic\nin terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across\nsystem-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the\ntheory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding\nlogits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process\ntrims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for\nbalancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs."}

In mathematics,\nlinearity underpins functions and vector spaces, forming the foundation of\nlinear algebra and functional analysis. In computer science, it relates to\nresource-sensitive computation. Linear Logic (LL), for instance, models\nassumptions that must be used exactly once, providing a natural framework for\ntracking computational resources such as time, memory, or data access. This\ndual perspective makes linearity essential to programming languages, type\nsystems, and formal models that express both computational complexity and\ncomposability. Bridging these interpretations enables rigorous yet practical\nmethodologies for analyzing and verifying complex systems.\n  This thesis explores the use of LL to model programming paradigms based on\nlinearity. It comprises two parts: ADLL and CryptoBLL. The former applies LL to\nAutomatic Differentiation (AD), modeling linear functions over the reals and\nthe transposition operation. The latter uses LL to express complexity\nconstraints on adversaries in computational cryptography.\n  In AD, two main approaches use linear type systems: a theoretical one\ngrounded in proof theory, and a practical one implemented in JAX, a Python\nlibrary developed by Google for machine learning research. In contrast,\nframeworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow support AD without linear types. ADLL\naims to bridge theory and practice by connecting JAX's type system to LL.\n  In modern cryptography, several calculi aim to model cryptographic proofs\nwithin the computational paradigm.

These attacks are undetectable with basic content\nmoderation on the dataset, highlighting the challenge of the task. With the\nbest set of affordances, our auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate of\nadversarial fine-tuning at a 1% false positive rate. Most promising, the\nauditor is able to detect covert cipher attacks that evade safety evaluations\nand content moderation of the dataset. While benign fine-tuning with\nunintentional subtle safety degradation remains a challenge, we establish a\nbaseline configuration for further work in this area. We release our auditing\nagent at https://github.com/safety-research/finetuning-auditor."}

A rapidly growing ecosystem has formed around MCP, including a wide\nrange of MCP hosts (i.e., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and Cline), MCP\nregistries (i.e., mcp.so, MCP Market, MCP Store, Pulse MCP, Smithery, and npm),\nand thousands of community-contributed MCP servers. Although the MCP ecosystem\nis gaining traction, there has been little systematic study of its architecture\nand associated security risks. In this paper, we present the first\ncomprehensive security analysis of the MCP ecosystem. We decompose MCP\necosystem into three core components: hosts, registries, and servers, and study\nthe interactions and trust relationships among them. Users search for servers\non registries and configure them in the host, which translates LLM-generated\noutput into external tool invocations provided by the servers and executes\nthem. Our qualitative analysis reveals that hosts lack output verification\nmechanisms for LLM-generated outputs, enabling malicious servers to manipulate\nmodel behavior and induce a variety of security threats, including but not\nlimited to sensitive data exfiltration. We uncover a wide range of\nvulnerabilities that enable attackers to hijack servers, due to the lack of a\nvetted server submission process in registries. To support our analysis, we\ncollect and analyze a dataset of 67,057 servers from six public registries. Our\nquantitative analysis demonstrates that a substantial number of servers can be\nhijacked by attackers. Finally, we propose practical defense strategies for MCP\nhosts, registries, and users. We responsibly disclosed our findings to affected\nhosts and registries."}

However, their\npractical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This\nchallenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token\ncounts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns\nrequired for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient\nor unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing\nindividual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an\nunderexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this\ngap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three\nstate-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control\nstrategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a\nnovel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings\nfirst reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no\nsingle model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show\nthat a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline,\nserves as a \"sweet spot\", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with\nminimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy\nconsistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better\nsolve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by\nintelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work\nprovides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering\nsimple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We\ndemonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement\napproach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents."}

This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a\nfew well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal\nefficacy of \"more is better\" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature\nof optimal prompting strategies.

A\ntheoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through\nattention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and\nsoftmax Lipschitz dynamics.

Despite this rapid\nprogress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these\nmodels' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing\nbenchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical\nevaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge\nthis gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs\nTrustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic\nassessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation\nframework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main\nimprovements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software\nengineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and\nMulti-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language,\ntext-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness\nAssessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code\ntransformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the\ntrustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and\nadaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26\nstate-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations,\nyielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance\nvariation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate\nspecific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;"}

Rather than\nsharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train\nthe global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy\nguarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy\nleakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the\ntraining data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion\nAttacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to\nreconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using\noptimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually\nreconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be\nenhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update\nInversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion\nmodels as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE\ncan be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely\nadopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach\nin two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets.\nOur results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe-\nart GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple\nmetrics.
