### [1] [On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135)
*Sumudu Liyanage,Sherlock A. Licorish,Markus Wagner,Stephen G. MacDonell*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个全面的APR工具评估框架，发现Sorald在修复SonarQube违规时虽然能解决特定问题，但会引入大量新缺陷、降低代码功能正确性并恶化代码结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估APR工具清除违规的能力，而忽视了其可能引入新违规、改变代码功能和降低代码结构质量的问题，需要开发全面的评估框架。

Method: 以Sorald为案例研究，评估其在2,393个Java代码片段中修复3,529个SonarQube违规的效果，分析修复后的新缺陷、功能正确性和代码结构变化。

Result: Sorald修复了特定规则违规，但引入了2,120个新缺陷（32个bug，2,088个代码异味），单元测试失败率达24%，代码结构恶化。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够捕捉APR工具全方位影响的评估方法，包括副作用，以确保其安全有效的应用。

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI虽然具有变革性能力，但由于其不可预测性和低效性，在开发可靠高效的GenAI赋能系统时面临重大挑战，需要新的系统设计方法

Method: 提出基于五大支柱（可靠性、卓越性、可进化性、自依赖性、保障性）的GenAI原生设计原则，以及GenAI原生单元、有机基质、可编程路由器等架构模式

Result: 构建了GenAI原生软件栈的关键要素框架，并从技术、用户采纳、经济和法律等多角度分析了系统影响

Conclusion: 该工作旨在激发未来研究，鼓励相关社区实施和完善这一概念框架，需要进一步的验证和实验

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

### [3] [An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423)
*Ruiqi Wang,Zezhou Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了知识蒸馏在代码理解任务中的有效性，发现特征蒸馏方法效果最佳，学生模型仅需5%参数即可达到教师模型98%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在代码理解中表现出色但计算成本高，知识蒸馏技术在其他领域成功应用但在代码理解领域研究不足

Method: 采用基于logit和基于特征的两种知识蒸馏方法，在8个学生模型和2个教师PLM上进行实验，覆盖3个下游任务

Result: 知识蒸馏显著提升学生模型性能，代码专用PLM作为教师效果更好，特征蒸馏方法表现最优，学生模型架构与教师相似性不一定带来更好性能

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是代码理解任务中有效的模型压缩技术，特征蒸馏方法最具潜力，为大规模部署高效代码理解模型提供了可行方案

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SynthCoder是一个集成行业最佳实践的代码补全模型，通过AST节点提取和启发式方法构建多样化数据集，使用BM25算法和调用图增强跨文件上下文，采用两阶段训练（课程学习和DPO对齐），在多个主流代码补全基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码补全模型的优化方法往往存在权衡问题，在某些数据集或指标上性能提升的同时在其他方面出现性能下降，甚至低于基线模型性能。需要一种能够避免这种seesaw效应、实现全面性能提升的方法。

Method: 1) 结合AST节点提取和模拟开发者行为的启发式方法构建多样化数据集；2) 使用BM25算法和调用图增强跨文件上下文信息；3) 以Seed-Coder-8B-Base为基础模型，采用两阶段训练：课程学习微调 + 基于拒绝采样生成偏好对的DPO对齐。

Result: 在aiXcoder、ExecRepoBench、CrossCodeEval和CoLT等主流仓库级代码补全基准测试中表现优异，达到state-of-the-art性能。训练集有效缓解了模型重复现有代码的常见问题。

Conclusion: SynthCoder通过精心设计的数据集构建、上下文增强技术和两阶段训练策略，成功实现了在代码补全任务上的全面性能提升，避免了传统优化方法的权衡问题，为代码补全模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

### [5] [Towards the Assessment of Task-based Chatbots: From the TOFU-R Snapshot to the BRASATO Curated Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15496)
*Elena Masserini,Diego Clerissi,Daniela Micucci,João R. Campos,Leonardo Mariani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个数据集TOFU-R和BRASATO，用于支持任务型聊天机器人的可靠性、安全性和鲁棒性评估研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前任务型聊天机器人的质量评估缺乏大规模、高质量的数据集，现有技术往往依赖有限样本或过时的代理，难以有效评估聊天机器人的可靠性。

Method: 创建了两个数据集：TOFU-R是从GitHub收集的Rasa聊天机器人快照，代表开源实践；BRASATO是经过筛选的最相关聊天机器人集合，基于对话复杂性、功能复杂性和实用性标准。

Result: 提供了两个高质量数据集和相应的工具支持，能够帮助研究人员创建和维护聊天机器人评估数据集。

Conclusion: 这些数据集将促进聊天机器人可靠性研究的可重复性，并为该领域的研究提供更好的基础支持。

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个用于设计和报告涉及大语言模型的实证研究的指南框架，包含8项核心指南，以解决LLM研究中的可复现性和可重现性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在软件工程研究中的应用日益普遍，但其非确定性、训练数据不透明和演进架构结构等特性给实证研究的可复现性和可重现性带来挑战。

Method: 通过社区合作开发了一个分类法，将LLM基础研究进行分类，并提出了8项设计和报告指南，包括必需标准和期望标准。

Result: 提出了一个包含八项核心指南的完整框架：声明LLM使用情况、报告模型配置、文档化工具架构、公开提示和交互日志、使用人工验证、使用开源LLM作为基准、报告适当的基准和指标、公开说明限制和缓解措施。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于克服LLM研究中的特殊挑战，提高实证研究的可复现性和可重现性，促进开政科学发展。该资源将作为活跃资源维护并为社区所使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

### [7] [QUPER-MAn: Benchmark-Guided Target Setting for Maintainability Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15512)
*Markus Borg,Martin Larsson,Philip Breid,Nadim Hagatulah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: QUPER-MAn模型将可维护性从被忽视的开发后果转变为主动管理的目标，通过基准测试和目标设定支持需求工程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可维护性在软件开发中至关重要但常被忽视，需求工程可以通过促进讨论和设定适当目标来解决这一问题

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了QUPER-MAn模型（QUPER模型的可维护性适配版本），整合可维护性基准测试并支持目标设定

Result: 研究发现可维护性仍然是次要质量关注点，明确需求通常只泛泛提及编码规范，工具虽常见但仅用于工程实践的隐式需求

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn模型能够通过知情和负责任的工程决策，将可维护性转变为主动管理的目标

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

### [8] [A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536)
*Yi Zhang,He Jiang,Xiaochen Li,Shikai Guo,Peiyu Zou,Zun Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VERMEI是一种测试FPGA逻辑综合工具的新方法，通过识别僵尸逻辑、等效变异和差分测试来发现工具缺陷，在实验中发现了15个bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA逻辑综合工具中的缺陷可能导致意外行为和安全隐患，现有测试方法存在测试程序语义和逻辑复杂性不足的问题。

Method: VERMEI包含三个模块：预处理模块通过仿真和覆盖率分析识别种子程序中的僵尸逻辑；等效变异模块通过贝叶斯采样从历史Verilog设计中提取逻辑片段，在僵尸区域修剪或插入逻辑片段生成等效变体；bug识别模块基于差分测试比较种子程序和变体程序的综合输出来识别bug。

Result: 在Yosys、Vivado和Quartus上的实验表明，VERMEI优于最先进的方法。在5个月内向供应商报告了15个bug，其中9个被确认为新bug。

Conclusion: VERMEI通过生成具有复杂控制流和结构的测试程序，有效提高了FPGA逻辑综合工具的测试效果，能够发现更多工具缺陷。

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 通过动态研究在IT公司建立技术债务管理过程，并分析实践者采用的研究方法和对技术债务意识的长期影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术债务管理研究很多但实践中采用少，需要在实际IT公司中建立可持续的TDM过程

Method: 采用动态研究方法（16个月内五个行动周期），通过问卷调查、团队会议观察、TD-SAGAT意识测量和背测数据评估来分析技术债务意识

Result: 实践者偏好基于系统进化和成本计算的技术债务还款和优先级排序，背测项目中的提醒机制能够提高技术债务意识

Conclusion: 工作坊基于方法可行且能引发可持续的过程改变，推出了适用于其他IT团队的新TDM思路

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

### [11] [MCPTox: A Benchmark for Tool Poisoning Attack on Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14925)
*Zhiqiang Wang,Yichao Gao,Yanting Wang,Suyuan Liu,Haifeng Sun,Haoran Cheng,Guanquan Shi,Haohua Du,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCPTox是首个系统评估LLM智能体对工具投毒攻击鲁棒性的基准，基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个工具构建，测试显示主流LLM智能体普遍存在漏洞，攻击成功率高达72.8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)为LLM智能体提供标准化外部工具接口，但引入了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注通过工具输出的攻击，而工具元数据中的恶意指令投毒威胁缺乏系统性评估

Method: 基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具构建MCPTox基准，设计3种攻击模板通过few-shot学习生成1312个恶意测试用例，覆盖10类潜在风险，在20个主流LLM智能体上进行评估

Result: 发现LLM智能体普遍易受工具投毒攻击，o1-mini攻击成功率72.8%。能力更强的模型更易受攻击，现有安全对齐机制无效，最高拒绝率(Claude-3.7-Sonnet)不到3%

Conclusion: 工具投毒是广泛存在的威胁，现有安全措施无法有效防御利用合法工具进行未授权操作的恶意行为。MCPTox为理解和缓解这一威胁提供了重要实证基准

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

TL;DR: 对模型提取攻击(MEAs)及其防御策略的全面综述，提出了新的分类法，分析了攻击技术、防御挑战，并讨论了技术、伦理、法律和社会影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLaaS平台的普及使得高级ML模型更易获取，但也引入了模型提取攻击的漏洞，威胁知识产权、隐私和系统安全，需要系统性的安全分析

Method: 提出基于攻击机制、防御方法和计算环境的新分类法，系统分析各种攻击技术效果，评估现有防御策略的效用与安全权衡

Result: 建立了MEAs的完整分类框架，揭示了现有防御在保持模型效用和确保安全之间的关键权衡挑战，提供了持续更新的文献库

Conclusion: 模型提取攻击是MLaaS平台的重要安全威胁，需要平衡安全性和实用性的新防御方案，未来研究应关注技术、伦理和法律等多维度解决方案

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated
with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

TL;DR: MoEcho揭示了混合专家(MoE)架构中的侧信道安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过硬件执行痕迹推断用户敏感数据，提出了四种新型侧信道攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构通过动态路由实现计算效率，但这种输入依赖的激活模式在硬件层面留下了可被利用的时空痕迹，构成了新的隐私攻击面。

Method: 提出了四种新型架构侧信道：CPU上的缓存占用通道和页面换出重加载，GPU上的性能计数器和TLB驱逐重加载，并基于这些漏洞设计了四种隐私攻击方法。

Result: 成功在基于MoE的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型上实现了提示推断、响应重建、视觉推断和视觉重建攻击，证明了严重的安全隐私威胁。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对现代Transformer中流行MoE结构的运行时架构级安全分析，揭示了严重的安全隐私风险，呼吁在开发高效大规模AI服务时需要及时有效的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user

*Sima Arasteh,Christophe Hauser*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文分析了机器学习在软件漏洞检测中的挑战，特别是数据集规模、评估方法和模型选择方面的问题，并分享了作者先前研究的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习在软件漏洞检测中取得进展，但现有方法在数据集评估、训练方式和模型粒度选择方面存在重要缺陷，需要系统性地探讨这些挑战。

Method: 通过分析当前机器学习漏洞检测方法的局限性，结合作者先前开发的Bin2vec和BinHunter两个研究项目的经验，提出改进建议。

Result: 识别了当前漏洞检测机器学习方法在数据集统计透明度、训练数据适用性和模型粒度选择等方面的关键问题。

Conclusion: 机器学习在漏洞检测领域的应用需要更严谨的数据集评估、更合适的训练方法以及更细致的模型粒度选择，作者的前期研究为此提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated impressive results in
various fields, including software vulnerability detection. Nonetheless, using
machine learning to identify software vulnerabilities presents new challenges,
especially regarding the scale of data involved, which was not a factor in
traditional methods. Consequently, in spite of the rise of new
machine-learning-based approaches in that space, important shortcomings persist
regarding their evaluation. First, researchers often fail to provide concrete
statistics about their training datasets, such as the number of samples for
each type of vulnerability. Moreover, many methods rely on training with
semantically similar functions rather than directly on vulnerable programs.
This leads to uncertainty about the suitability of the datasets currently used
for training. Secondly, the choice of a model and the level of granularity at
which models are trained also affect the effectiveness of such vulnerability
discovery approaches.
  In this paper, we explore the challenges of applying machine learning to
vulnerability discovery. We also share insights from our two previous research
papers, Bin2vec and BinHunter, which could enhance future research in this
field.

### [16] [Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Evolving Network Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15100)
*Ehssan Mousavipour,Andrey Dimanchev,Majid Ghaderi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetSight是一个用于网络数据异常检测的监督学习框架，能够在线持续检测和适应分布偏移，无需人工干预，通过伪标签技术和知识蒸馏策略实现自适应，在三个长期网络数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布偏移是深度学习异常检测系统面临的关键挑战，现有方法要么需要昂贵的人工标注，要么依赖难以获取的干净数据，这些要求在现实中难以满足。

Method: NetSight采用新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，并使用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略来防止灾难性遗忘，实现在线持续检测和适应分布偏移。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上的评估显示，NetSight相比依赖人工标注的最先进方法具有优越的适应性能，F1分数提升高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight证明了其在经历分布偏移的动态网络中具有鲁棒性和有效性，能够有效解决分布偏移带来的挑战。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

### [17] [Conditional Cube Attack on Round-Reduced ASCON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15172)
*Zheng Li,Xiaoyang Dong,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文评估了认证加密算法Ascon对类立方体攻击的安全性，提出了针对5/6轮缩减版Ascon的新条件立方体攻击方法，并首次实现了对7轮Ascon的密钥恢复攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ascon是CAESAR竞赛第三轮的16个幸存算法之一，之前最好的密钥恢复攻击只能达到6轮，而类似结构的Keccak密钥模式攻击可达7轮以上。本文旨在突破这一限制。

Method: 推广了条件立方体攻击方法，引入立方体类密钥子集技术，将整个密钥空间根据不同的密钥条件划分为多个子集，对每个子集使用立方体测试器进行测试。

Result: 将6轮攻击的时间复杂度从理论上的2^66降低到实际的2^40；首次实现了7轮密钥恢复攻击，总时间复杂度约为2^103.9；对于大小为2^117的弱密钥子集，攻击成本仅为2^77。

Conclusion: 虽然这些攻击对完整12轮Ascon不构成威胁，但为理解Ascon的安全性提供了新的见解，展示了条件立方体攻击方法在分析复杂非线性层密码算法中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the secure level of authenticated encryption
\textsc{Ascon} against cube-like method. \textsc{Ascon} submitted by Dobraunig
\emph{et~al.} is one of 16 survivors of the 3rd round CAESAR competition. The
cube-like method is first used by Dinur \emph{et~al.} to analyze Keccak keyed
modes. At CT-RSA 2015, Dobraunig \emph{et~al.} applied this method to 5/6-round
reduced \textsc{Ascon}, whose structure is similar to Keccak keyed modes.
However, for \textsc{Ascon} the non-linear layer is more complex and state is
much smaller, which make it hard for the attackers to select enough cube
variables that do not multiply with each other after the first round. This
seems to be the reason why the best previous key-recovery attack is on 6-round
\textsc{Ascon}, while for Keccak keyed modes (Keccak-MAC and Keyak) the
attacked round is no less than 7-round.
  In this paper, we generalize the conditional cube attack proposed by Huang
\emph{et~al.}, and find new cubes depending on some key bit conditions for
5/6-round reduced \textsc{Ascon}, and translate the previous theoretic 6-round
attack with $2^{66}$ time complexity to a practical one with $2^{40}$ time
complexity. Moreover, we propose the first 7-round key-recovery attack on
\textsc{Ascon}. By introducing \emph{the cube-like key-subset technique}, we
divide the full key space into many subsets according to different key
conditions. For each key subset, we launch the cube tester to determine if the
key falls into it. Finally, we recover the full key space by testing all the
key subsets. The total time complexity is about $2^{103.9}$. In addition, for a
weak-key subset, whose size is $2^{117}$, the attack is more efficient and
costs only $2^{77}$ time complexity. Those attacks do not threaten the full
round (12 rounds) \textsc{Ascon}.

*Badih Ghazi,Pritish Kamath,Alexander Knop,Ravi Kumar,Pasin Manurangsi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文扩展了效用优先的差分隐私方法，支持任意私有估计器序列，最多只需原始隐私预算的两倍，并能无额外成本进行超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私采用"隐私优先"视角，但实践中用户更关注"效用优先"——先确定所需效用水平，再计算相应的隐私成本。现有研究主要局限于简单的拉普拉斯或高斯噪声机制。

Method: 扩展Wu等人[2019]和Liu与Talwar[2019]的工作，支持任意私有估计器序列，通过相关噪声添加和渐进减少技术，实现效用优先的隐私保护。

Result: 实现了最多只需原始隐私预算两倍的效用优先隐私机制，支持无额外成本的超参数调优，并扩展到ex-post Renyi差分隐私。

Conclusion: 本文显著推广了效用优先差分隐私的适用范围，为实际应用提供了更灵活和高效的隐私-效用权衡方案。

Abstract: The conventional approach in differential privacy (DP) literature formulates
the privacy-utility trade-off with a "privacy-first" perspective: for a
predetermined level of privacy, a certain utility is achievable. However,
practitioners often operate under a "utility-first" paradigm, prioritizing a
desired level of utility and then determining the corresponding privacy cost.
  Wu et al. [2019] initiated a formal study of this "utility-first" perspective
by introducing ex-post DP. They demonstrated that by adding correlated Laplace
noise and progressively reducing it on demand, a sequence of increasingly
accurate estimates of a private parameter can be generated, with the privacy
cost attributed only to the least noisy iterate released. This led to a Laplace
mechanism variant that achieves a specified utility with minimal privacy loss.
However, their work, and similar findings by Whitehouse et al. [2022], are
primarily limited to simple mechanisms based on Laplace or Gaussian noise.
  In this paper, we significantly generalize these results. In particular, we
extend the work of Wu et al. [2019] and Liu and Talwar [2019] to support any
sequence of private estimators, incurring at most a doubling of the original
privacy budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hyperparameter tuning for
these estimators, including the selection of an optimal privacy budget, can be
performed without additional privacy cost. Finally, we extend our results to
ex-post Renyi DP, further broadening the applicability of utility-first privacy
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出RAGAN框架，利用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力生成高质量虚假用户档案，提升推荐系统的数据投毒攻击效果和隐蔽性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统易受数据投毒攻击，但现有方法生成的虚假文本评论质量差，影响攻击效果和隐蔽性。攻击者在黑盒系统中需要具有可迁移性的高质量档案

Method: 提出RAGAN框架，使用演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略增强上下文学习。通过越狱器生成档案，并由指令代理和守护者协同优化，提高攻击可迁移性和隐蔽性

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，RAGAN实现了最先进的中毒攻击性能

Conclusion: RAGAN框架能有效生成高质量的虚假用户档案，为评估推荐系统鲁棒性提供了有力工具

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet-connected vehicle technologies has
introduced a new era of smart mobility, while simultaneously raising
significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. This paper explores the
evolving threat landscape associated with connected vehicles, focusing on risks
such as unauthorized remote access and the potential leakage of personal data.
To assess the current state of protection, we conducted a comprehensive
analysis of 16 international standards and regulations, evaluating them from
multiple perspectives including regulatory strength, technical specificity,
treatment of supply chain risks, and approaches to personal data handling.
  In parallel, we carried out a user-focused survey designed to map consumer
attitudes toward smart cars. The survey investigated which types of vehicles
users trust and prefer, the reasons behind rejecting certain car types, their
awareness of data-related risks, and whether they feel adequately informed
about how their vehicles handle data. By combining regulatory analysis with
user perception insights, this study aims to contribute to a more holistic
understanding of the challenges and expectations surrounding connected vehicle
ecosystems.

*Hengyu An,Jinghuai Zhang,Tianyu Du,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tao Lin,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IPIGuard是一种防御间接提示注入攻击的新方法，通过工具依赖图(TDG)将动作规划与外部数据交互解耦，有效减少恶意工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在与不受信任数据源交互时容易受到间接提示注入(IPI)攻击，现有防御方法依赖模型内在安全性假设，缺乏结构性约束。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，将代理任务执行建模为工具依赖图(TDG)的遍历过程，明确分离动作规划和外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间取得了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard通过结构性约束显著增强了代理系统对抗IPI攻击的鲁棒性，为动态环境中更安全的智能代理系统开发铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究建立了LLVM前向边缘控制流完整性(CFI)变体与内存损坏漏洞类别的分类映射，为开发者在现有代码库中逐步部署CFI提供实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存损坏漏洞仍然是软件安全最严重的威胁之一，虽然控制流完整性(CFI)可以缓解这类攻击，但开发者缺乏如何在实际软件中应用CFI的具体指导。

Method: 基于Top 10已知被利用漏洞(KEV)列表，识别四个高影响漏洞类别并为每个类别选择一个代表性CVE，评估LLVM的CFI对这些CVE的防护效果。

Result: 研究发现CFI在两个案例中成功阻止了漏洞利用，但在另外两个案例中失败，展示了CFI的潜力和当前局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为CFI在生产系统中的实际部署提供了决策支持，并为改进CFI的实用性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to
software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code
execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,
developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to
real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's
forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering
actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in
existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one
representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and
explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other
two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support
informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the
practical use of CFI in production systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BadFU攻击，首次展示了联邦学习中通过遗忘请求注入后门的攻击方式，恶意客户端使用后门和伪装样本训练模型，然后请求遗忘伪装样本，使全局模型变为后门状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私和监管合规要求的增长，联邦学习中的机器遗忘技术变得越来越重要，但将遗忘整合到联邦学习中带来了新的安全风险，特别是对手可能利用遗忘过程破坏全局模型的完整性。

Method: 提出BadFU攻击策略，恶意客户端在联邦训练过程中同时使用后门样本和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，然后请求遗忘伪装样本，使全局模型转变为后门状态。

Result: 在各种联邦学习框架和遗忘策略下的广泛实验验证了BadFU的有效性，揭示了当前联邦遗忘实践中的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦遗忘机制中的严重安全漏洞，强调了开发更安全、更鲁棒的联邦遗忘机制的迫切需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Conclusion: Mars系统成功实现了移动应用安全风险的自动化识别，显著提升分析效率，证据链机制为人工审核提供有力支持，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Mobile application marketplaces are responsible for vetting apps to identify
and mitigate security risks. Current vetting processes are labor-intensive,
relying on manual analysis by security professionals aided by semi-automated
tools. To address this inefficiency, we propose Mars, a system that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated risk identification and profiling.
Mars is designed to concurrently analyze multiple applications across diverse
risk categories with minimal human intervention. To enhance analytical
precision and operational efficiency, Mars leverages a pre-constructed risk
identification tree to extract relevant indicators from high-dimensional
application features. This initial step filters the data, reducing the input
volume for the LLM and mitigating the potential for model hallucination induced
by irrelevant features. The extracted indicators are then subjected to LLM
analysis for final risk determination. Furthermore, Mars automatically
generates a comprehensive evidence chain for each assessment, documenting the
analytical process to provide transparent justification. These chains are
designed to facilitate subsequent manual review and to inform enforcement
decisions, such as application delisting. The performance of Mars was evaluated
on a real-world dataset from a partner Android marketplace. The results
demonstrate that Mars attained an F1-score of 0.838 in risk identification and
an F1-score of 0.934 in evidence retrieval. To assess its practical
applicability, a user study involving 20 expert analysts was conducted, which
indicated that Mars yielded a substantial efficiency gain, ranging from 60% to
90%, over conventional manual analysis.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为描述性状态表示和规范性奖励函数两个独立组件，但作者认为这两个方面可能从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现，这一可能性尚未被计算化表述。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别。通过统计散度来衡量行为策略与期望经验特征之间的差异，提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解跨不同基质的目性行为提供了新的理论视角，挑战了传统强化学习的分离模型假设，强调了目标导向状态在认知智能体中的核心作用。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract

spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with

*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型控制人群代理运动的新方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航，使代理能够基于社交互动和环境感知做出更真实的运动决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群动画方法主要局限于转向和固定高层目标推断，缺乏考虑语言对话等复杂社交环境互动对人群导航和运动的影响。

Method: 使用基于代理的LLM系统，结合角色个性、欲望和关系生成代理间对话，并利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制每个代理的导航和转向。

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了方法有效性，观察到代理自动分组和解组，实现了人群内部信息传递机制，产生了更真实的人群模拟和自然涌现的群体行为。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语言模型驱动的社交互动，显著提升了人群模拟的真实性，使群体行为能够从环境设置中自然涌现。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型的自信心检测准确性，发现增加推理资源反而导致过度自信，而基于搜索的方法能显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在问题回答中存在的过度自信问题，需要系统性地评估推理能力和计算资源对自信心评估准确性的影响。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和地球健康领域，系统评估推理能力和计算资源对自信心评估的影响，对比了纯推理与搜索增强生成的表现。

Result: 推理LLM在专家自信心评估中仅获得48.7%准确率，增加推理资源反而导致过度自信，而搜索增强生成能达到89.3%准确率。

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或推理资源，所谓的"测试时扩展"范式可能不是改善知识密集型任务自信心检测的关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升安全指标并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐性，导致不安全行为。现有方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1) MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2) SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3) 事后修剪这些层以降低风险。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改进安全指标，同时保持或改进效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大型离线数据集，在开放宇宙协助游戏中表现出色

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl通过创新的基础设施、数据生成方法和能力集成，为GUI代理任务提供了强大的基础模型，Mobile-Agent-v3在此基础上实现了性能突破，为GUI自动化领域树立了新的技术标准

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量可验证的数学逻辑数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)技术，将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范，通过系统性的变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，并通过复制机制确保有效性

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化谜题的基准测试集，训练后PuzzleClone平均得分从14.4提升到56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得最高12.5个百分点的绝对提升

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够有效生成大规模、多样化且可验证的逻辑谜题数据集，显著提升LLM的逻辑推理能力，为解决数据可靠性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用受到罕见病数据稀缺和不可靠的阻碍，多汗症作为一种影响2-3%人口的罕见疾病，目前缺乏专门的LLM支持系统。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）使用前沿LLM从开源数据生成医学上合理的合成病例；2）在开源基础模型上进行微调；3）临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和同理心。

Result: 实验显示LLM4Sweat优于基线模型，提供了首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，并为其他具有类似数据挑战的罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了专门针对多汗症的LLM支持系统，证明了在数据稀缺情况下通过合成数据生成和专家验证可以构建有效的医疗AI系统，为其他罕见疾病的LLM应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

Motivation: 当前缺乏对大语言模型在高约束环境下推理可靠性的系统评估，特别是在资源约束项目调度这类NP完全问题中。

Method: 构建可扩展的评估框架，逐步增加非冗余的前序约束、停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中进行实例化测试。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近上限，但当多种约束交互时性能急剧下降，约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在复杂约束交互下的泛化能力有限，合成测试的性能不能保证在实际领域场景中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Motivation: 扩散模型在照片真实感方面表现出色，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表的需求，需要一种能够保持空间精度和结构完整性的草图到图表生成方法。

Conclusion: 该方法优先考虑定性推理而非脆弱的数值估计，保持全局约束（对齐、连接性），支持人机协同修正，输出为可编程SVG，易于通过API扩展到演示工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上与三种方法进行对比实验，证明了方法的有效性。消融学习确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量的稳健性和存储开销，显示了其实际价值。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够构建高质量的长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

TL;DR: 提出了Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架，通过粗到细粒度的记忆机制增强LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，解决现有单粒度记忆方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在复杂规划任务中主要使用单粒度记忆机制，受限于收集经验的质量，导致知识多样性和规划灵活性不足。

Method: 提出粗到细粒度记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）面对环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思。

Conclusion: 粗到细粒度记忆机制能够有效克服单粒度记忆的局限性，为LLM智能体提供更丰富的知识表示和更灵活的规划能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好两种人类反馈，通过相似性搜索实现更准确的信用分配，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高。人类反馈中，专家演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好反馈易于收集但信用分配问题未解决

Method: SPW方案：对偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效联合学习偏好和演示，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW方案成功统一了两种人类反馈源，解决了偏好反馈中的信用分配问题，实现了更准确的离线强化学习

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在旅行规划中存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，缺乏详细的一站式规划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策，包含修订需求和环境感知。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA来处理真实世界的旅行规划挑战。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能提升，表明在真实世界旅行规划方面取得了显著进展。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架提供了有希望的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力不足，且缺乏开放式推理支持，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的解决方案。

Method: 使用lead-independent编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得强劲性能，并保持对分布外设置的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLM中的潜力，为医疗推理提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and

minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

TL;DR: 提出了Think in Blocks框架，通过将推理过程划分为可调节的块数，使LLM能够根据任务复杂度动态调整推理长度，避免过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的思维链推理在处理复杂逻辑任务时表现优异，但过长的推理链会导致过度思考、计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理深度。

Method: 建立块结构范式，模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后相应划分推理；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的DPO、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制推理深度。

Result: 实现了从零推理到深度推理的自适应能力，能够根据问题难度调整推理深度，在部署时灵活控制思维链长度。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过块结构化和自适应训练实现了推理深度的动态调节，提高了推理效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Motivation: 随着自主人工智能代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。受超加性合作理论启发，该研究旨在探索重复互动和群体间竞争如何影响AI代理的合作行为。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组为团队，在囚徒困境游戏中相互对抗。通过模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争，分析合作行为的变化。

Result: 研究发现内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动的初始合作倾向。群体间竞争反直觉地导致了更多合作行为。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略提供了新框架，证明了群体间竞争可以促进合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并开发了MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标来测量安全边界。

Result: 实验证明该框架能够提供全面可解释的策略行为评估，成功识别出仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了形式化的安全验证方法，能够识别不安全区域的安全屏障和系统的收敛特性，为安全关键应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: HDM是基于向量符号的ACT-R声明性记忆系统替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，能够与现有ACT-R模型兼容运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM)作为ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，旨在获得更好的可扩展性、架构定义的块相似性，同时保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R实现中，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理流水线将大型文档内容添加到记忆系统中，并创建基于向量表示检索完整记忆块的机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM能够保持向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的回忆能力），同时使之前的ACT-R模型只需极少修改即可在该系统上运行。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号记忆系统与ACT-R框架的集成，为后续改进时间上下文表示和开发基于实例学习的决策模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Motivation: 现有MARL系统主要基于显式奖励信号或价值函数评估团队整体性能，但缺乏在无价值反馈情况下理解个体智能体行为贡献的方法。

Method: 利用信息论Shapley值计算ICVs，通过评估智能体动作对队友策略决策不确定性和偏好对齐的影响，量化其对合作同伴工具性赋能的因果影响。

Result: 在合作和竞争MARL环境中的分析显示，ICVs能够识别智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度，并区分哪些行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为MARL系统提供了新的合作动态洞察，增强了可解释性，能够在无价值反馈的情况下有效评估智能体个体贡献。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [56] [Futurity as Infrastructure: A Techno-Philosophical Interpretation of the AI Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15680)
*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，提出AI数据生命周期产生递归价值链，挑战现有负责任AI框架，主张监管需关注基础设施和时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI政策制定缺乏对AI技术运作和经济逻辑中'生成动态'的考量，需要从技术哲学角度分析监管盲点，特别是数据递归利用带来的权力不对称问题。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，构建AI生命周期模型（前个体环境、个体化、个体化AI），引入'未来性'概念分析数据递归生成特性。

Result: 揭示了AI基础设施（如特征存储）如何通过反馈、适应和时间递归实现价值集中，突出了科技寡头在数据捕获、训练和部署中的权力不对称。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

TL;DR: GRAFT是一个结构化多模态基准测试，用于评估模型在指令跟随、视觉推理和视觉-文本对齐任务上的表现，通过程序化生成的图表和合成渲染的表格提供精确的评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型评估缺乏对结构化视觉推理任务的系统性测试，需要一种能够控制数据语义、结构和清晰度的基准来全面评估模型的视觉推理能力。

Method: 使用Python可视化库程序化生成图表和合成渲染表格，为每个实例配对基于视觉内容的多步骤分析问题，答案采用JSON或YAML等结构化格式，并建立推理类型分类法。

Result: 创建了一个统一的、可扩展的评估框架，能够对多模态模型在视觉基础的结构化推理任务上进行细粒度基准测试。

Conclusion: GRAFT为多模态模型的视觉推理能力评估设立了新的标准，提供了精确、一致的评估方法，支持对推理过程和输出格式的全面评估。

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at
https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl.

TL;DR: 本文首次在生产环境中测量AI推理的环境影响，发现Gemini文本提示的中位数能耗仅为0.24Wh，远低于公开估计，并展示了谷歌通过软件效率和清洁能源实现的显著减排效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI应用加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但此前缺乏生产环境中的实际测量研究。

Method: 提出并执行了全面的测量方法，涵盖AI服务基础设施的完整堆栈，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能耗、空闲机器容量和数据中心能耗开销，通过对谷歌Gemini AI助手基础设施的详细监测。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示的中位数能耗为0.24Wh，比看电视9秒的能耗还低；水消耗相当于5滴水（0.26mL）。谷歌的软件效率改进和清洁能源采购使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹减少44倍。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务的环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注。全面的环境指标测量对于准确比较模型和激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

TL;DR: 使用语言模型实时评估对话中的假社交关系线索，通过五步测试准确检测所有假社交对话而无误报


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人与AI代理形成的假社交关系对人类健康造成严重危害，需要一种能够在私密对话中及旹识别这种动态的方法

Method: 重新调整最先进语言模型构建简单的响应评估框架，在实时对话中评估假社交线索，使用30个合成对话数据集进行迭代测试

Result: 在宽松一致性规则下，五步测试成功识别所有假社交对话且没有假阳性，检测通常在前几次交流中完成

Conclusion: 评估代理为防止假社交关系提供了可行的解决方案，这些发现为该方法提供了初步证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: LGT是一个基于多智能体大语言模型的配置优化框架，通过自然语言推理和文本梯度实现智能配置调优，在六个数据集上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性和动态适应性，自动化方法难以进行语义推理。

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架，包含提议配置变更的Advisor、评估进展的Evaluator和优化决策过程的Optimizer，通过文本梯度提供语义反馈。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著性能提升，同时保持高可解释性。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的智能配置优化，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，实现了性能提升和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.
