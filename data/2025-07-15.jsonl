We define immutability as\nthe cryptographic persistence of historical states in an append-only data\nstructure and contrast it with trust, understood as a rational epistemic\nexpectation under uncertainty. Employing predicate logic, automata-theoretic\nmodels, and epistemic game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that immutability\nneither entails nor implies correctness, fairness, or credibility. Through\nformal constructions and counterexamples--including predictive fraud schemes\nand the phenomenon of garbage permanence--we show that the belief conflates\nstructural and epistemic domains. Immutability preserves all data equally,\nregardless of veracity. Therefore, the assertion that immutability guarantees\ntrust collapses under the weight of formal scrutiny."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction.

Branch-based workflows typically define a set of remote branches\nwith well-defined objectives, such as feature branches, a branch for feature\nintegration, and a main branch.

By targeting the\nleast significant bit (LSB) of non-transparent alpha layer image values, the\nproposed method successfully conceals compressed JavaScript code inside a\nfavicon image without affecting visual fidelity. Global web traffic loads 294\nbillion favicons daily and consume 0.9 petabytes of network bandwidth. A\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that a 64x64 ICO image can embed\nup to 512 bytes uncompressed, or 0.8 kilobyte when using lightweight two-fold\ncompression. On page load, a browser fetches the favicon as part of standard\nbehavior, allowing an embedded loader script to extract and execute the payload\nentirely in memory using native JavaScript APIs and canvas pixel access. This\ncreates a two-stage covert channel requiring no additional network or user\nrequests. Testing across multiple browsers in both desktop and mobile\nenvironments confirms successful and silent execution of the embedded script.\nWe evaluate the threat model, relate it to polymorphic phishing attacks that\nevade favicon-based detection, and analyze evasion of content security policies\nand antivirus scanners. We map nine example MITRE ATT&CK Framework objectives\nto single line JavaScript to execute arbitrarily in ICO files. Existing\nsteganalysis and sanitization defenses are discussed, highlighting limitations\nin detecting or neutralizing alpha-channel exploits. The results demonstrate a\nstealthy and reusable attack surface that blurs traditional boundaries between\nstatic images and executable content. Because modern browsers report silent\nerrors when developers specifically fail to load ICO files, this attack surface\noffers an interesting example of required web behaviors that in turn compromise\nsecurity."}

Current\nmethods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when\nfacing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation\ncapabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless\ncoordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving\nscenarios.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection.

Moreover, compared to images and\ntext, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can\nbe exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in\nunderstanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the\nlack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2)\nthe limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from\naudio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark\ndataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world\ndata, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we\npropose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary\nstrengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to\nenhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in\ninferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the\nALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in\ngenerating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts\nsignificantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive\nattributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense\nstrategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work\nvalidates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs,\nhighlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework\nto facilitate future research."}

To do\nso, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of\n(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular\ngradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy\nsuitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as\nbalance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that\nleverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.\nFinally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our\ngradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess\nconvergence."}

Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection.

This paper\npresents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and\nprioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach\nleverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to\ngroup related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying\nincidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on\npredefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that\nprioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness,\nsource credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental\nevaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method\neffectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security\nanalysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum\ndiscussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses\nfundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis."}

On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and\nrequires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand,\nmachine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a\nhigh computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations\nare required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language\nmodels (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through\nprompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant\noptions, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations\nacross various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT\nsolvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable\nlimitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert\nknowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other\ncases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and\nthe design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration."}

Due to challenges related\nto distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and\nsophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance\ncapabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout\nthe inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with\nminimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system\nleverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly\non encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security.\nFurthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed\nto preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a\nSingle-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a\nsecure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption.\nThis approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial\ndata but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy\nprotection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based\nsecure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data\nconfidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than\n1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption."}

LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated\nLLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without\nsharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local\nadapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying\ndifferential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise\nto both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one\nadapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose\nFedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double\nSketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of\nboth low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized\nSVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first\naggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then\nreconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating\nof both adapters. We theoretically prove FedASK's differential privacy\nguarantee and its exact aggregation property. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FedASK consistently outperforms baseline methods across a\nvariety of privacy settings and data distributions."}

Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in generating such specifications from natural language\nintents, but the giant model size and high computational demands raise a\nfundamental question: Do we really need large models for this task? In this\npaper, we show that a small, fine-tuned language model can achieve high-quality\npostcondition generation with much lower computational costs. We construct a\nspecialized dataset of prompts, reasoning logs, and postconditions, then\nsupervise the fine-tuning of a $7$B-parameter code model. Our approach tackles\nreal-world repository dependencies and preserves pre-state information,\nallowing for expressive and accurate specifications. We evaluate the model on a\nbenchmark of real-world Java bugs (Defects4J) and compare against both\nproprietary giants (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source large models. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that our compact model matches or outperforms significantly\nlarger counterparts in syntax correctness, semantic correctness, and\nbug-distinguishing capability.
