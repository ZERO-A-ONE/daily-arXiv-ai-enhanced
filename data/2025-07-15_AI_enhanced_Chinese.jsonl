Employing predicate logic, automata-theoretic\nmodels, and epistemic game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that immutability\nneither entails nor implies correctness, fairness, or credibility. Through\nformal constructions and counterexamples--including predictive fraud schemes\nand the phenomenon of garbage permanence--we show that the belief conflates\nstructural and epistemic domains.

However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens.

In particular, to combat\neavesdropping attacks, the closed-form expressions of successful BA probability\nand covert transmission rate are first derived. Then, a covert communication\nproblem aimed at jointly optimizing beam training budget and transmission power\nis formulated to maximize covert communication rate, subject to the covertness\nrequirement. An alternating optimization algorithm combined with successive\nconvex approximation is employed to iteratively achieve optimal results. To\ncombat impersonation attacks, the mutual coupling effect of antenna array\nimpairments is explored as a device feature to design a weighted-sum energy\ndetector based physical layer authentication scheme. Moreover, theoretical\nmodels for authentication metrics like detection and false alarm probabilities\nare also provided to conduct performance analysis. Based on these models, an\noptimization problem is constructed to determine the optimal weight value that\nmaximizes authentication accuracy. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that\nCovertAuth presents improved detection accuracy under the same covertness\nrequirement compared to existing works.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCovertAuth\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u5192\u5145\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5411\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u5192\u5145\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u6210\u529f\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u548c\u9690\u853d\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0cCovertAuth\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CovertAuth\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

The preservation of\nbiodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the\nsustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats,\nincluding habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive\nspecies. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local\nand global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and\nconservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation\nModels (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by\nleveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to\nvarious downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity\nconservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model\ntailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning.

Users communicate\ntheir feedback in app reviews, frequently emphasizing ethical concerns, such as\nprivacy and security. Incorporating these reviews has proved to be useful for\nmany areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement engineering, testing,\netc.). However, app reviews related to ethical concerns generally use\ndomain-specific language and are typically overshadowed by more generic\ncategories of user feedback, such as app reliability and usability. Thus,\nmaking automated extraction a challenging and time-consuming effort.\n  This study proposes CMER (A \\underline{C}ontext-Aware Approach for\n\\underline{M}ining \\underline{E}thical Concern-related App\n\\underline{R}eviews), a novel approach that combines Natural Language Inference\n(NLI) and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large Language Model (LLM) to extract\nethical concern-related app reviews at scale. In CMER, NLI provides\ndomain-specific context awareness by using domain-specific hypotheses, and the\nLlama-like LLM eliminates the need for labeled data in the classification task.\nWe evaluated the validity of CMER by mining privacy and security-related\nreviews (PSRs) from the dataset of more than 382K app reviews of mobile\ninvestment apps.

By targeting the\nleast significant bit (LSB) of non-transparent alpha layer image values, the\nproposed method successfully conceals compressed JavaScript code inside a\nfavicon image without affecting visual fidelity. Global web traffic loads 294\nbillion favicons daily and consume 0.9 petabytes of network bandwidth. A\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that a 64x64 ICO image can embed\nup to 512 bytes uncompressed, or 0.8 kilobyte when using lightweight two-fold\ncompression. On page load, a browser fetches the favicon as part of standard\nbehavior, allowing an embedded loader script to extract and execute the payload\nentirely in memory using native JavaScript APIs and canvas pixel access. This\ncreates a two-stage covert channel requiring no additional network or user\nrequests. Testing across multiple browsers in both desktop and mobile\nenvironments confirms successful and silent execution of the embedded script.\nWe evaluate the threat model, relate it to polymorphic phishing attacks that\nevade favicon-based detection, and analyze evasion of content security policies\nand antivirus scanners. We map nine example MITRE ATT&CK Framework objectives\nto single line JavaScript to execute arbitrarily in ICO files. Existing\nsteganalysis and sanitization defenses are discussed, highlighting limitations\nin detecting or neutralizing alpha-channel exploits. The results demonstrate a\nstealthy and reusable attack surface that blurs traditional boundaries between\nstatic images and executable content. Because modern browsers report silent\nerrors when developers specifically fail to load ICO files, this attack surface\noffers an interesting example of required web behaviors that in turn compromise\nsecurity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528ICO\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u4ef6\u7684alpha\u900f\u660e\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u89e3\u538bJavaScript\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6709\u6548\u4f4d\uff08LSB\uff09\u9690\u85cf\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u6bcf\u5929\u52a0\u8f7d2940\u4ebf\u4e2afavicon\uff0c\u6d88\u80170.9PB\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e38\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u975e\u900f\u660ealpha\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6709\u6548\u4f4d\u5d4c\u5165\u538b\u7f29JavaScript\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u52a0\u8f7dfavicon\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u8f7d\u8377\u3002", "result": "64x64 ICO\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165512\u5b57\u8282\uff08\u672a\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u62160.8KB\uff08\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u65e0\u58f0\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

These results\ndemonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset\ncreation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE\ntool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated\nfrom 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench\nVerified).", "AI": {"tldr": "SPICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "SPICE\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u7406\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "SPICE\u57281000\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u4ece10\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u964d\u81f35.10\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SPICE\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Our key insight is that parallel hybrid approaches eliminate the\nmultiplicative latency penalties inherent in sequential methods mandated by RFC\n9370, achieving significant performance improvements under realistic network\nconditions. Performance evaluation using a Docker-based testing framework with\nIDQuantique QKD hardware demonstrates that the parallel hybrid approach\nsignificantly outperforms sequential methods under network latency conditions,\nwhile pure QKD achieves minimal bandwidth overhead through identifier-based key\ncoordination.

OpenCAMS is designed to support\nadvanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by\ncombining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides\nlarge-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D\nperception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables\nmodular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular\nvehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized,\nbidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation\nprogression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while\npreserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and\nrender a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control\nlogic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and\ntraffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to\nboth mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside\nunits) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the\nfoundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and\nfuture-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this\ncore without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture.

We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation\ncapabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless\ncoordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving\nscenarios.

The\nNEATEST framework has been used for automated testing in Scratch games,\nemploying neuroevolution-based test generation optimized for statement\ncoverage. However, statement coverage alone is often insufficient for fault\ndetection, as it does not guarantee execution of all logical branches. This\npaper introduces a branch coverage-based fitness function to enhance test\neffectiveness in automated game testing. We extend NEATEST by integrating a\nbranch fitness function that prioritizes control-dependent branches, guiding\nthe neuroevolution process to maximize branch exploration. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of this approach, empirical experiments were conducted on 25\nScratch games, comparing Neatest with Statement Coverage (NSC) against Neatest\nwith Branch Coverage (NBC). A mutation analysis was also performed to assess\nthe fault detection capabilities of both techniques.

It\nis critical for the quality assurance of gaming software. Manual playtesting is\ntime-consuming and expensive. However, automating this process is challenging,\nas playtesting typically requires domain knowledge and problem-solving skills\nthat most conventional testing tools lack. Recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence (AI) have opened up new possibilities for applying Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to playtesting. However, significant challenges remain: current\nLLMs cannot visually perceive game environments, and most existing research\nfocuses on text-based games or games with robust APIs. Many non-text games lack\nAPIs to provide textual descriptions of game states, making it almost\nimpossible to naively apply LLMs for playtesting. This paper introduces Lap,\nour novel approach to LLM-based Automatic Playtesting, which uses ChatGPT to\ntest match-3 games, a category of games where players match three or more\nidentical tiles in a row or column to earn points. Lap encompasses three key\nphases: processing of game environments, prompting-based action generation, and\naction execution. Given a match-3 game, Lap takes a snapshot of the game board\nand converts it to a numeric matrix. It then prompts the ChatGPT-O1-mini API to\nsuggest moves based on that matrix and tentatively applies the suggested moves\nto earn points and trigger changes in the game board. It repeats the\nabove-mentioned three steps iteratively until timeout. For evaluation, we\nconducted a case study using Lap on an open-source match-3 game, CasseBonbons,\nand empirically compared it with three existing tools.

Recent research seeks to address this\nby automating code review entirely, but we believe that this risks losing the\nmajority of the interpersonal benefits such as knowledge transfer and shared\nownership.\n  We believe that by better understanding the cognitive processes involved in\ncode review, it would be possible to improve tool support, with out without AI,\nand make code review both more efficient, more enjoyable, while increasing or\nmaintaining all of its benefits. In this paper, we conduct an ethnographic\nthink-aloud study involving 10 participants and 34 code reviews.

To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout\nthe inference phase.

This\ncapability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured\nwithout direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and\ntext, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can\nbe exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in\nunderstanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the\nlack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2)\nthe limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from\naudio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark\ndataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world\ndata, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we\npropose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary\nstrengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to\nenhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in\ninferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the\nALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in\ngenerating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts\nsignificantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive\nattributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense\nstrategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling.

The HAPPO\nalgorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update\nscheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).\nHowever, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing\n(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$\nwith the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\\phi_{\\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived\nfrom Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating\nthe conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential\npolicy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)\nas the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to\noptimize different Q-value estimations.

However, existing unlearning\nmethods mainly focus on recovering trigger patterns but fail to restore the\ncorrect semantic labels of poison samples. This limitation prevents them from\nfully eliminating the false correlation between the trigger pattern and the\ntarget label. To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels. Moreover, the features of poison samples restore to\nclosely resemble those of corresponding clean samples after adding adversarial\nperturbations. Building upon these insights, we propose Backdoor Unlearning via\nadversaRial bouNdary analysis (BURN), a novel defense framework that integrates\nfalse correlation decoupling, progressive data refinement, and model\npurification. In the first phase, BURN employs adversarial boundary analysis to\ndetect poisoned samples based on their abnormal adversarial boundary distances,\nthen restores their correct semantic labels for fine-tuning. In the second\nphase, it employs a feedback mechanism that tracks prediction discrepancies\nbetween the original backdoored model and progressively sanitized models,\nguiding both dataset refinement and model purification.

Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt.

In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information.

Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments.

Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene\ngeneration, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a\nhandful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We\nthen extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel\nscenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed\nscenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a\npre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,\naddressing critical challenges in computational immunology", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cMAML\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e3D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}
