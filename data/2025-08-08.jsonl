While this integration\nleverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their\nrobustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first\nstep to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing\nadversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for\npoisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two\nrepresentative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.\n2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an\nattacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence\ntemplate to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals\nthat certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with\nspecific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its\nvulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater\nrobustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature\nperturbation attacks.

However,\nrecent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum\nalgorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental\nquestion: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard\ndiscrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work,\nwe investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group\nplatforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a\ngeneralized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical\nalgorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the\nBaby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity\n$O(\\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure.\nThrough theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we\ndemonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent\nand does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields\n$\\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in\nelliptic curves $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded\nautomorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the\nSDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue\nstructure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian\nstructure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased\nclassical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems\nfor cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the\nunderlying algebraic structures."}

Surprisingly, 51.08% of these\ndependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay\nof 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often\nspend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a\nmedian of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify\ndependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML\nmodels. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,\nwhile the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed\nmodels demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%\nand 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the\nsecond model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k\nprecision has room for improvement."}

Drawing from historical analysis and\ncontemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum\nrequirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing\nsystems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,\nlearning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.\nThis approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while\npreserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining\npotential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific\nrecommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for\nterminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach\noffers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while\nsupporting more effective policy development."}

We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of\nthose libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of\nthe box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries\nover standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively\nlicensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the\nlibraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches\nbetween import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)\nprovided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,\nthe lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving\ndependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both\ndevelopers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the\nreliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software\ndependencies."}

Given the ability of\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers\nare exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work\nfocuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log\ngeneration underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,\nwhere comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate\nthe capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML\nprojects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing\n4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed\nthe original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,\nand evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text\nquality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we\nmanually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common\npatterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place\nas humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of\n82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level\nlogging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,\ndifficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with\nproject-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for\ngenerating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed\nfor practical implementation."}

While this integration\nleverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their\nrobustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first\nstep to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing\nadversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for\npoisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two\nrepresentative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.\n2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an\nattacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence\ntemplate to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals\nthat certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with\nspecific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its\nvulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater\nrobustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature\nperturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework\nGALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate\nfeature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against\nstructural attacks."}

However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical\noutputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention\nweight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault\ntaxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by\nattention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable\ndiagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive\nempirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work\nis based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96\nprojects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack\nOverflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven\nattention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results\nshow that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to\nattention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations\nof these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root\ncause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that\nexplain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic\ndiagnostic guidance for attention-based models."}

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising\ndirection, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model\nlearns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.\nTo address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively\nincorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying\nrewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO\neffectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning\nwith final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior\nperformance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only\nbaselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further\ndemonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to\nmathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available."}

However, identifying the right response actions for\ncomplex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to\nmitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.\nRecent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current\nmethods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is\ncostly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting\na novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced\nhallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information\nretrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response\nplans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can\nbe made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under\ncertain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can\nrun on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents\nreported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)\nachieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes\nto a broad range of incident types and response actions."}
