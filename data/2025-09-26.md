### [1] [ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20380)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM是专门针对OpenACC指令生成进行微调的两个开源大语言模型，能够为数据并行循环生成专家级OpenACC指令，显著提升指令生成的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU编程日益复杂，虽然OpenACC等基于指令的并行编程标准简化了GPU编程，但仍需要专业知识才能有效使用这些指令。

Method: 通过从GitHub C/C++仓库中挖掘的4,033个OpenACC指令-循环对构建监督微调数据集，并使用该数据集对基础LLM进行微调。

Result: 在测试集上，基础LLM无法持续生成有效指令，而微调后的模型能生成正确指令类型的有效指令达87%，完全匹配的指令达50%。

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM为LLM驱动的OpenACC指令生成建立了可复现的基准，降低了串行程序自动GPU卸载的门槛。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

### [2] [State-of-the-Art in Software Security Visualization: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20385)
*Ishara Devendra,Chaman Wijesiriwardana,Prasad Wimalaratne*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文对软件安全可视化技术进行了系统性综述，提出了包含图基、符号基、矩阵基和隐喻基四种类型的分类法，分析了60多篇关键研究论文，强调了该领域的主要问题、最新进展和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统日益复杂和威胁环境不断演变，传统的基于文本和数值的安全分析方法变得越来越低效，需要将复杂的安全数据转化为易于理解的视觉格式。

Method: 通过文献系统综述方法，对60多篇软件安全可视化领域的关键研究论文进行分析，建立综合分类法将可视化技术分为四种类型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发适应不断演变安全环境的创新可视化技术的必要性，这些技术在增强威胁检测、改进安全响应策略和指导未来研究方面具有实际意义。

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

### [3] [Dynamic ReAct: Scalable Tool Selection for Large-Scale MCP Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20386)
*Nishant Gaurav,Adit Akarsh,Ankit Ranjan,Manoj Bajaj*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Dynamic ReAct是一种新方法，让ReAct智能体能够高效处理超出大语言模型上下文限制的大型MCP工具集，通过渐进式工具选择架构减少50%的工具加载量同时保持任务完成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在包含数百或数千个可用工具的环境中，由于大语言模型上下文内存限制而无法同时加载所有工具的根本性挑战。

Method: 提出并评估了五种渐进式工具选择架构，最终采用搜索-加载机制实现智能工具选择，最小化计算开销。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能将工具加载量减少高达50%，同时保持任务完成准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了真正通用AI智能体的发展，使其能够动态适应多样化任务环境。

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

### [4] [Towards Systematic Specification and Verification of Fairness Requirements: A Position Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20387)
*Qusai Ramadan,Jukka Ruohonen,Abhishek Tiwari,Adam Alami,Zeyd Boukhers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出基于知识图谱的框架来解决公平性需求规范和验证的缺失问题，认为歧视问题往往源于缺乏明确的公平性需求规范而非算法设计缺陷或数据偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将软件系统中的歧视问题归因于算法设计缺陷或数据偏见，但忽视了公平性需求规范缺失这一根本原因。专家关于公平性的知识往往是隐性的，导致难以制定精确且可验证的公平性需求。

Method: 借鉴安全工程领域的经验，提出开发基于知识图谱的框架来形式化公平性知识，辅助需求规范和验证。

Result: 本文讨论了相关挑战、研究问题，并提出了解决这些研究问题的路线图。

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法有望为公平性需求工程提供形式化机制，填补当前公平性验证方法的空白。

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

### [5] [Online-Optimized RAG for Tool Use and Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20415)
*Yu Pan,Xiaocheng Li,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Online-Optimized RAG是一个部署时框架，通过在线梯度更新持续优化检索嵌入，解决嵌入对齐问题，提高工具选择和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中由于不完美的嵌入模型或噪声描述导致的嵌入对齐问题，这种对齐错误可能导致检索错误和任务失败。

Method: 使用轻量级在线梯度更新，从实时交互中持续调整检索嵌入，仅需最小反馈（如任务成功），无需改变底层LLM，支持单跳和多跳工具使用、动态工具库和K检索重排序。

Result: 在各种工具使用和文档检索场景中，该方法持续提高了工具选择准确性和最终任务成功率。

Conclusion: Online-Optimized RAG为构建稳健、自我改进的RAG系统提供了一条简单实用的路径。

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

### [6] [Formal Verification of Legal Contracts: A Translation-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20421)
*Reiner Hähnle,Cosimo Laneve,Adele Veschetti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Stipula是一种领域特定编程语言，用于建模具有可执行属性的法律合同，特别是涉及资产转移和义务的合同。本文提出了一种通过将Stipula合同转换为带有Java建模语言规范的Java代码来形式化验证其正确性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种方法来形式化验证法律合同的正确性，特别是那些涉及资产转移和义务的合同，以确保合同条款的准确执行和避免潜在的法律风险。

Method: 将Stipula合同翻译成带有Java建模语言规范的Java代码，并使用KeY演绎验证工具作为验证后端，自动验证具有不相交循环的Stipula合同的偏正确性和总正确性。

Result: 翻译和验证过程完全自动化，成功验证了具有不相交循环的Stipula合同子集的正确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通用的演绎验证工具可以成功应用于翻译方法中，为法律合同的自动验证提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

### [7] [AI-Specific Code Smells: From Specification to Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20491)
*Brahim Mahmoudi,Naouel Moha,Quentin Stievenert,Florent Avellaneda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SpecDetect4AI是一个基于工具的方法，用于大规模规范和检测AI特定代码异味，结合了高级声明式领域特定语言和可扩展的静态分析工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的兴起带来了新的软件问题，现有检测工具常常无法识别AI特定的代码异味，这些异味可能导致不可重现性、静默故障或模型泛化能力差等问题。

Method: 开发了SpecDetect4AI方法，结合高级声明式DSL进行规则规范，以及可扩展的静态分析工具来检测AI系统中的代码异味。

Result: 在826个AI系统（2000万行代码）上评估，实现了88.66%的精确度和88.89%的召回率，优于现有检测工具，SUS得分为81.7/100。

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI通过专用规则有效支持AI特定代码异味的规范和检测，能够高效分析大型AI系统，展示了良好的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

### [8] [PromptDebt: A Comprehensive Study of Technical Debt Across LLM Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20497)
*Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究首次对LLM集成中的技术债务进行了大规模实证分析，发现OpenAI集成占54.49%的SATD实例，提示设计是主要债务来源（6.61%），其中基于指令的提示（38.60%）和少样本提示（18.13%）最易产生债务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM通过API越来越多地嵌入软件，这些集成带来了特有的技术债务问题，需要系统性地研究其来源、普遍性和缓解策略。

Method: 通过分析93,142个Python文件中主要LLM API的使用情况，识别和分类LLM特定的技术债务实例。

Result: 研究发现54.49%的SATD来自OpenAI集成，12.35%来自LangChain使用；提示设计是主要债务来源（6.61%），其中基于指令的提示（38.60%）和少样本提示（18.13%）最易产生债务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM集成中技术债务的具体模式，发布了全面的SATD数据集支持可复现性，并为管理LLM系统的技术债务提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

*Sayed Mahbub Hasan Amiri,Md Mainul Islam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于AI-Python的聊天机器人，通过结合静态代码分析、动态执行追踪和大型语言模型，帮助学生解决编程问题，提升学习效果。该系统在1500名学生提交中表现出85%的错误解决成功率，显著优于传统工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程工具如IDE和静态分析器缺乏智能辅导功能，而AI代码助手如GitHub Copilot主要关注代码完成而非学习过程。本研究旨在填补这一空白，开发一个能够提供相关实用建议、促进学习过程的AI聊天机器人。

Method: 采用混合架构，使用CodeLlama进行代码嵌入，GPT-4处理自然语言交互，Docker沙箱确保安全执行。通过静态代码分析、动态执行追踪和LLMs相结合的方式提供个性化辅导。

Result: 系统在1500名学生提交中达到85%的错误解决成功率，优于pylint（62%）和GPT-4（73%）。用户调试时间减少59.3%，编程能力测试显示编码熟练度提升34%，特别是在递归和异常处理方面。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI工具如何平衡技术创新与教学关怀，优先考虑教育公平和长期技能保留而非单纯代码完成。聊天机器人证明了AI可以增强人类教学，促进编程教育中更深层次的概念理解。

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

### [10] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的故障定位框架，通过结合LLM的功能提取、语义密集检索和重排序，显著提升了方法级故障定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在复杂系统中进行故障定位时缺乏项目特定知识，且难以处理大型项目。FaR-Loc旨在通过RAG技术解决这些限制。

Method: 框架包含三个核心组件：LLM功能提取模块生成失败行为的自然语言描述；语义密集检索组件在共享语义空间中嵌入功能描述和覆盖方法；LLM重排序模块基于上下文相关性重新排序检索到的方法。

Result: 在Defects4J基准测试中，FaR-Loc在Top-1准确率上比SoapFL和AutoFL分别提升14.6%和9.1%，在Top-5准确率上分别提升19.2%和22.1%，且无需重新训练即可超越所有基于学习和频谱的基线方法。

Conclusion: FaR-Loc通过结合LLM和RAG技术有效提升了故障定位性能，特别是使用包含代码结构的预训练嵌入模型（如UniXcoder）可将Top-1准确率提升高达49.0%。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

distribution of programming language topics within source code becomes
increasingly important for guiding technical decisions, improving onboarding,

implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic
classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector
Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained
localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual
functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet
dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75
in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a
reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis
and data-driven software engineering.

*Daniela Grassi,Fabio Calefato,Darja Smite,Nicole Novielli,Filippo Lanubile*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过多模态方法分析混合会议中的参与度模式，发现现场和远程参与者的参与度相当，但远程参与者在长会议中参与度较低。积极角色、会议规模和时间是影响参与度的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行后混合工作的广泛采用改变了软件开发实践，带来了沟通协作的新挑战。远程参与可能导致团队成员孤立、疏离和参与度下降，需要客观测量混合会议中的参与度差异。

Method: 研究了三家软件公司的专业人员，采用多模态方法测量参与度，包括自我报告问卷和生物特征设备收集的生理测量数据，分析混合会议中的参与动态。

Result: 回归分析显示现场和远程参与者参与度相当，但远程参与者在长会议中参与度较低。积极角色与更高参与度正相关，而大型会议和下午时段与较低参与度相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为混合会议中的参与度和脱离因素提供了见解，提出了会议改进建议，这些见解不仅适用于软件团队，也适用于面临类似混合协作挑战的知识密集型组织。

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

### [13] [Verification Limits Code LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837)
*Srishti Gureja,Elena Tommasone,Jingyi He,Sara Hooker,Matthias Gallé,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成数据验证的瓶颈问题，提出了验证天花板概念，并探讨了验证策略对模型性能的影响。研究发现当前验证过程过于严格，需要重新校准验证标准来提升代码生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成模型越来越多地依赖合成数据，验证过程的质量和多样性受到验证器能力的限制，这形成了验证天花板瓶颈。本文旨在系统研究验证设计如何影响模型性能。

Method: 通过系统实验研究：(i) 验证内容：分析测试复杂度和数量的影响；(ii) 验证方式：探索宽松通过标准和LLM软验证；(iii) 验证必要性：比较正确与错误解决方案以及人工评估。

Result: 丰富测试套件平均提升3个pass@1点；宽松验证标准可回收有价值训练数据，提升2-4个pass@1点；保留每个问题的多样化正确解决方案能带来一致的泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证实践过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性，但不能完全抛弃验证。通过校准验证与多样化问题-解决方案对的结合，可以突破验证天花板，开发更强的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Method: PseudoBridge采用两阶段方法：1）使用大语言模型合成伪代码实现NL查询与伪代码的显式对齐；2）通过逻辑不变的代码风格增强策略生成风格多样但逻辑等价的代码实现，并将不同风格的代码片段与伪代码对齐。

Result: 在10种不同预训练语言模型和6种主流编程语言上的广泛实验表明，PseudoBridge持续优于基线方法，在检索准确性和泛化性方面取得显著提升，特别是在零样本域迁移场景下。

Conclusion: 通过伪代码实现显式逻辑对齐是有效的，PseudoBridge展示了作为稳健、可泛化代码检索解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

TL;DR: CodeHinter是一个结合传统调试工具和LLM技术的调试助手，旨在帮助编程新手修复语义错误并促进他们在调试过程中的积极参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI调试工具容易导致学生对AI过度依赖，缺乏主动参与调试过程。需要设计一个既能有效修复错误又能促进学生主动学习的调试工具。

Method: 结合传统调试工具和LLM技术，设计CodeHinter调试助手，通过第二次设计迭代并在本科生群体中进行测试。

Result: 学生认为该工具在解决语义错误方面非常有效，比第一版显著更容易使用，错误定位是最有价值的功能。

Conclusion: AI辅助调试工具应根据用户配置文件进行个性化定制，以优化与学生的互动效果。

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Stack Overflow上量子开发者提出的2829个问题，通过内容分析和扎根理论识别出6类常见挑战，并使用Transformer模型进行分类，BERT DistilBERT达到95%准确率，优于传统深度学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子软件工程开发者面临优化量子计算和QSE概念的挑战，但Stack Overflow上的量子标签帖子往往关注技术层面而非开发者问题。对问题按量子概念分类有助于识别频繁的QSE挑战。

Method: 从问答平台提取2829个量子相关标签问题，通过内容分析和扎根理论识别常见挑战类别，使用ChatGPT验证人工标注，并比较Transformer模型（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa）与传统深度学习模型（FNN、CNN、LSTM）的分类性能，应用SHAP进行模型可解释性分析。

Result: 识别出6类挑战：工具、理论、学习、概念、错误和API使用。Transformer模型平均准确率达95%，优于传统深度学习模型（89%、86%、84%），准确率提升6%。SHAP分析揭示了语言特征如何驱动预测。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法在处理实际讨论时优于传统深度学习方法，这些发现可帮助量子供应商和论坛更好地组织讨论以提高可访问性和可读性，但需要与实际开发者和供应商进行实证评估研究。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

TL;DR: MelcotCR是一种基于思维链的微调方法，通过长思维链技术为代码审查提供丰富的结构化信息，使小型LLM在代码审查任务上达到甚至超越大型模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于微调的代码审查方法受限于训练数据的有限性和模糊性，无法像人类审查者那样同时分析代码审查的多个维度。

Method: 提出MelcotCR方法，结合最大熵建模原则和预定义推理路径，解决LLM处理长思维链提示时的上下文丢失和推理逻辑丢失问题。

Result: 在MelcotCR数据集和CodeReviewer数据集上的实验表明，14B参数的Qwen2.5模型经过MelcotCR微调后，在代码问题检测和描述准确性上超越现有最优方法，性能与671B的DeepSeek-R1模型相当。

Conclusion: MelcotCR通过增强LLM的推理能力，使小型模型在代码审查任务上实现与大模型相当的性能，为高效代码审查提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台上的公民参与日益重要，但由于贡献量巨大，手动分类不可行，需要专家参与且必须与官方分类法对齐，因此需要自动化解决方案来充分利用这些参与数据。

Method: 采用BERTopic主题建模方法，结合种子词引导和大型语言模型进行自动验证，实现大规模公民参与内容的自动化分类。

Result: 初步结果表明，生成的主题具有连贯性且与机构分类对齐，仅需极少的人工干预。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效帮助政府将大量公民输入转化为可操作的公共政策数据，解决了大规模参与内容分类的挑战。

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MARS的新型联邦学习后门防御方法，通过利用后门能量(BE)来识别恶意神经元，并使用集中后门能量(CBE)和基于Wasserstein距离的聚类来有效检测后门模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法失败的原因在于采用了与后门攻击松散耦合的经验统计度量。特别是最新的3DFed攻击使用指示器机制自适应优化后门模型，使现有防御失效。

Method: MARS利用后门能量(BE)指示每个神经元的恶意程度，提取最显著的BE值形成集中后门能量(CBE)，并引入基于Wasserstein距离的聚类方法来识别后门模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MARS能够有效防御最先进的后门攻击，性能显著优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: MARS通过更紧密地耦合后门攻击特征，提供了一种有效的联邦学习后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

*Jiayi Lin,Liangcai Su,Junzhe Li,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: R1-Fuzz是一个利用强化学习专门化成本效益语言模型进行复杂文本模糊测试输入生成的框架，通过覆盖切片问题构建和距离奖励计算，使小型模型在真实模糊测试中媲美甚至超越大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试在复杂目标（如编译器、解释器、数据库引擎）上效果有限，因为这些目标需要满足复杂语法和语义约束的文本输入。虽然语言模型具有潜力，但实际应用受限，主要挑战包括对真实代码库深层程序逻辑探索不足以及大模型成本高昂。

Method: 提出R1-Fuzz框架，采用强化学习专门化成本效益语言模型，包含两个关键设计：覆盖切片问题构建和距离奖励计算。通过基于强化学习的后训练，将语言模型紧密集成到模糊测试工作流中，推理深层程序语义。

Result: 在多样化真实目标上的评估显示，R1-Fuzz-7B小型模型能够媲美甚至超越更大模型。相比最先进模糊测试工具，覆盖率达到75%提升，并发现29个先前未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: R1-Fuzz证明了通过强化学习专门化小型语言模型在复杂文本模糊测试中的实用性，为成本效益的漏洞发现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

TL;DR: 本文提出并应用了一种新型的专家验证隐私评分卡，用于评估AI编程助手的数据隐私保护水平，揭示了不同工具间存在20分的隐私保护差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI编程助手在开发者工作流程中的快速集成引发了严重的隐私和信任问题，开发者将专有代码托付给这些服务时，不清楚的数据处理实践带来了安全和合规风险。

Method: 通过详细分析四种文档类型（从法律政策到外部审计），基于14个加权标准对五个领先的AI编程助手进行评分，评分标准和权重由法律专家和数据保护官员共同完善。

Result: 结果显示隐私保护存在明显的等级差异，最高分和最低分工具之间有20分的差距。分析发现了行业普遍弱点，包括普遍使用选择退出同意进行模型训练，以及几乎普遍未能主动过滤用户提示中的敏感信息。

Conclusion: 该评分卡为开发者和组织提供了可操作的指导，建立了透明度的新基准，并倡导AI行业向更以用户为中心的隐私标准转变。

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense
sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the
increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication
protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging
due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple
sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and
interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a
focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We
present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models,
namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on
a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types.
Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value
imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and
extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews
Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate
the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence
intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME,
were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance,
enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed
approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures
interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical
drone operations.

Motivation: 随着神经网络在生产系统和个人使用中的广泛应用，网络检查点经常被共享和分发，这带来了神经网络隐写恶意软件的安全威胁，但这一威胁被深度学习从业者和安全专家普遍忽视。

Method: 提出通过打乱权重矩阵和偏置矩阵的列顺序（相当于卷积层的通道顺序）来有效中和恶意载荷，这种方法不会影响网络精度。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效破坏最先进神经网络隐写方法嵌入的恶意载荷，性能显著优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了可能的防御规避方法，提出了额外的防御措施，并呼吁继续研究机器学习系统的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

TL;DR: 论文指出语音深度伪造检测器在基准测试中表现良好，但在实际部署中面临覆盖债务问题，即新条件（设备、采样率、编码器、环境、攻击家族）的增长速度超过数据收集速度，导致检测盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示语音深度伪造检测器在开放世界部署中的安全风险，强调最坏情况性能而非平均基准分数决定安全性，以应对不断变化的攻击条件。

Method: 通过跨测试框架分析结果，按真实语音域和伪造语音发布年份分组，识别检测器的性能模式。

Result: 发现新型合成器消除了检测器依赖的传统伪影，且对话语音域（电话会议、访谈、社交媒体）始终最难保护。

Conclusion: 检测器不应单独用于高风险决策，而应作为包含来源验证、身份凭证和政策保障的多层防御体系中的辅助信号。

Abstract: Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style
conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices,
sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a
``coverage debt" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with
existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be
collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case
performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate
the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent
cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof
release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy
artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains
(teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to
secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for
high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within
layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy
safeguards.

Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

Abstract: Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC), promises transformative advances,
including AI-enabled quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption
protocols. However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating
complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically
studied. These risks affect the trustworthiness and reliability of AI and QAI
systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews
67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data
risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five
categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user
considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities
unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work
contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for
developing future risk assessment tools.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在共享信息物理系统仿真时如何保护网络信息免受隐私系统识别攻击，通过将节点激励的差分隐私机制与图滤波器的谱特性相结合，为图移位算子提供形式化隐私保证。


<details>

Motivation: 传统系统识别方法旨在估计系统参数，而本文关注逆向问题：在保持合法分析实用性的前提下，如何防止对手识别图移位算子。

Method: 将网络状态观测建模为由差分隐私节点激励驱动的图滤波器时间序列输出，分析DP高斯信号的谱特性对隐私边界的影响。

Result: 研究表明，应用DP机制到输入可以为GSO提供形式化隐私保证，隐私边界由图滤波器和噪声协方差的谱特性决定，平滑滤波器和低条件数协方差能提供更强的隐私保护。

Conclusion: 差分隐私机制与图信号处理的结合为网络信息隐私保护提供了理论基础，谱特性分析为隐私-效用权衡提供了量化依据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from
privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system
simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series
outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal
excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift
operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we
study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from
identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show
that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for
the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of
the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals,
the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine
the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance
yielding greater privacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论分析框架，用于研究选择性加密作为防御模型反转攻击的基本原理，并通过实证研究量化影响防御效果的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的梯度共享存在模型反转攻击漏洞，特别是深度梯度泄漏（DLG）。虽然同态加密被提出作为防御机制，但完全加密所有梯度计算开销大。选择性加密方法旨在平衡隐私保护和计算效率，但现有文献缺乏对加密与非加密参数谱行为的理论探索。

Method: 提出了一个选择性加密的理论分析框架，并通过全面的实证研究识别和量化关键因素（如模型复杂度、加密比例和暴露梯度）对防御效果的影响。

Result: 理论框架阐明了梯度选择与隐私保护之间的关系，实验评估展示了这些因素如何影响防御模型反转攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献推进了对选择性加密机制的理解，并为设计高效、可扩展的隐私保护联邦学习系统提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy by keeping raw data locally stored on client devices, preventing
access from other clients or the central server. However, recent studies reveal
that sharing model gradients creates vulnerability to Model Inversion Attacks,
particularly Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG), which reconstructs private
training data from shared gradients. While Homomorphic Encryption has been
proposed as a promising defense mechanism to protect gradient privacy, fully
encrypting all model gradients incurs high computational overhead. Selective
encryption approaches aim to balance privacy protection with computational
efficiency by encrypting only specific gradient components. However, the
existing literature largely overlooks a theoretical exploration of the spectral
behavior of encrypted versus unencrypted parameters, relying instead primarily
on empirical evaluations. To address this gap, this paper presents a framework
for theoretical analysis of the underlying principles of selective encryption
as a defense against model inversion attacks. We then provide a comprehensive
empirical study that identifies and quantifies the critical factors, such as
model complexity, encryption ratios, and exposed gradients, that influence
defense effectiveness. Our theoretical framework clarifies the relationship
between gradient selection and privacy preservation, while our experimental
evaluation demonstrates how these factors shape the robustness of defenses
against model inversion attacks. Collectively, these contributions advance the
understanding of selective encryption mechanisms and offer principled guidance
for designing efficient, scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动钓鱼检测方法缺乏可解释性和对新钓鱼攻击的鲁棒性，需要开发既能提供鲁棒性又能解释决策过程的检测方法。

Method: 使用字符级深度学习模型（CharCNN、CharGRU、CharBiLSTM）在自定义电子邮件数据集上进行评估，采用三种测试场景：标准训练测试、对抗攻击下的测试以及对抗训练测试。

Result: 在计算资源受限的环境下，CharGRU在所有场景中表现最佳。所有模型都对对抗攻击表现出脆弱性，但对抗训练显著提高了它们的鲁棒性。通过适配Grad-CAM技术实现了模型决策的可视化解释。

Conclusion: 字符级深度学习模型能够有效检测钓鱼攻击并提供可解释性，CharGRU在资源受限环境下是最优选择，对抗训练可显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合移动货币认证框架，结合USSD多因素认证和JWT安全会话管理，针对撒哈拉以南非洲地区的资源受限环境设计，相比传统方法显著提升了认证速度、成功率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 撒哈拉以南非洲地区移动货币服务快速普及但互联网渗透率低，现有移动货币认证方法存在SIM交换攻击易受性、会话保护弱和高峰期可扩展性差等关键限制。

Method: 采用混合认证框架，结合USSD多因素认证（SIM验证、PIN输入和会话令牌绑定）和基于JWT的安全会话管理，设计了三因素认证模型。

Result: 相比基于OAuth的单点登录方法，认证时间减少45%（8秒 vs 12-15秒），网络条件差时成功率提高15%（95% vs 80%），抗钓鱼和暴力攻击能力增强，渗透测试显示漏洞暴露大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为SSA及其他类似约束地区提供了离线可访问性和安全会话连续性的混合认证协议，解决了SIM交换和社会工程等威胁，展示了面向数千用户的可扩展性，推动了安全数字包容性发展。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Mobile Money Services (MMS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
offers a viable path to improve e-Government service accessibility in the face
of persistent low internet penetration. However, existing Mobile Money
Authentication (MMA) methods face critical limitations, including
susceptibility to SIM swapping, weak session protection, and poor scalability
during peak demand. This study introduces a hybrid MMA framework that combines
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD)-based multi-factor
authentication with secure session management via cryptographically bound JSON
Web Tokens (JWT). Unlike traditional MMA systems that rely solely on SIM-PIN
verification or smartphone-dependent biometrics, our design implements a
three-factor authentication model; SIM verification, PIN entry, and session
token binding, tailored for resource-constrained environments. Simulations and
comparative analysis against OAuth-based Single Sign-On (SSO) methods reveal a
45% faster authentication time (8 seconds vs. 12 to 15 seconds), 15% higher
success under poor network conditions (95% vs. 80%), and increased resistance
to phishing and brute-force attacks. Penetration testing and threat modeling
further demonstrate a substantial reduction in vulnerability exposure compared
to conventional approaches. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) a
hybrid authentication protocol that ensures offline accessibility and secure
session continuity; (2) a tailored security framework addressing threats like
SIM swapping and social engineering in SSA; and (3) demonstrated scalability
for thousands of users with reduced infrastructure overhead. The proposed
approach advances secure digital inclusion in SSA and other regions with
similar constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各行业的广泛部署，AI系统的自主性和访问权限扩大使其成为恶意攻击的目标。现有方法无法预防零日攻击，需要类似恶意软件防护的风险最小化策略。

Method: 系统集成三个核心组件：威胁情报系统将新兴威胁转化为防护措施；数据平台聚合和丰富信息，提供可观测性和ML运维；发布平台实现安全快速的检测更新而不中断客户工作流。

Result: 该系统能够提供分层保护以应对不断演变的LLM威胁，同时生成训练数据用于持续模型改进，并实现无中断的生产部署更新。

Conclusion: 该生产级防御系统通过借鉴成熟的恶意软件防护实践，为LLM提供了有效的多层级保护机制，解决了现有方法无法应对零日攻击的挑战。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FHE技术已在真实平台中部署，但其可靠性方面，特别是对故障的响应机制，一直被忽视。需要理解FHE计算在内存故障下的行为特征。

Method: 通过实验分析不同FHE方案在内存故障条件下的表现，包括单个操作和应用程序级别的行为，并测试传统和FHE特定故障缓解技术的效果。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in
cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking
privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real
platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond
to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of
how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of
individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different
FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific
fault mitigation techniques are.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络中加密后门的双重作用，既可用于实施隐蔽攻击，也可用于构建可证明鲁棒的防御机制，为机器学习安全提供新思路。

Method: 采用Goldwasser等人的理论框架，设计并实现了基于加密后门的攻击和防御协议，包括水印方案、认证协议和IP追踪机制，并在先进神经网络架构上进行实证验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的防御协议能抵抗黑盒攻击，而基于后门的攻击在标准假设下无法被预防。同时支持后量子密码原语的应用。

Conclusion: 加密后门在神经网络安全中具有重要价值，为量子时代的机器学习应用奠定了基础，但防御相关的理论证明仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN)
can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well
as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted
cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN.
Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN
watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication;
and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual
property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from
Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these
instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The
protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary
with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial
attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the
theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et.
al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all
these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with
empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can
utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors,
laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于机器学习的网络入侵检测系统具有优势，但由于其不透明的决策过程，网络安全专家在实际生产环境中部署这些模型时存在犹豫。

Method: 设计了一个深度学习模型ExpIDS，使其具有高决策树解释保真度，即决策树解释的预测与ExpIDS的预测尽可能接近。该系统还能适应网络流量分布的变化。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，ExpIDS在常见攻击检测性能上与最先进的NIDS相当，同时在决策树解释保真度方面表现更高，能够适应不同程度的真实世界流量漂移。

Conclusion: ExpIDS成功解决了机器学习NIDS的可解释性问题，同时保持了良好的检测性能和对现实世界流量变化的适应性。

Abstract: Despite all the advantages associated with Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDSs) that utilize machine learning (ML) models, there is a
significant reluctance among cyber security experts to implement these models
in real-world production settings. This is primarily because of their opaque
nature, meaning it is unclear how and why the models make their decisions. In
this work, we design a deep learning-based NIDS, ExpIDS to have high decision
tree explanation fidelity, i.e., the predictions of decision tree explanation
corresponding to ExpIDS should be as close to ExpIDS's predictions as possible.
ExpIDS can also adapt to changes in network traffic distribution (drift). With
the help of extensive experiments, we verify that ExpIDS achieves higher
decision tree explanation fidelity and a malicious traffic detection
performance comparable to state-of-the-art NIDSs for common attacks with
varying levels of real-world drift.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可撤销属性基加密方案在效率、安全性、动态可扩展性等方面难以达到最优平衡，限制了其在物联网环境中的实际应用。

Method: 设计支持数据完整性的快速RABE方案，实现多挑战密文的自适应安全，将撤销计算任务卸载到云端，保证数据完整性和正确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，在相同访问策略下，该方案的计算消耗比现有方案减少7-9倍，性能优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方案成功解决了RABE方案在物联网环境中的效率和安全平衡问题，为云存储和外包数据环境提供了实用的细粒度访问控制方案。

Abstract: Efficient and secure revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) is vital for
ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control and data sharing in cloud
storage and outsourced data environments within the Internet of Things (IoT).
However, current RABE schemes often struggle to achieve an optimal balance
between efficiency, security, dynamic scalability, and other important
features, which hampers their practical application. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a fast RABE scheme with data integrity for IoT that
achieves adaptive security with multiple challenge ciphertexts. Our scheme
supports the revocation of authorized users and transfers the computationally
heavy revocation processes to the cloud, thereby easing the computational
burden on IoT devices. Moreover, it consistently guarantees the integrity and
correctness of data. We have demonstrated its adaptive security within the
defined security model with multiple challenge ciphertexts and optimized its
performance. Experimental results indicate that our scheme provides better
performance than existing solutions. Under the same access policy, our scheme
reduces computational consumption by 7 to 9 times compared to previous schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的定向模糊测试方法如DirectFuzz存在支持硬件描述语言有限、无法扩展到大型电路、存在抽象不匹配等问题，需要更有效的定向测试技术。

Method: PROFUZZ采用定向灰盒模糊测试（DGF）方法，结合ATPG的结构分析能力，生成精确的输入种子来更有效地针对特定设计区域。

Result: 实验显示PROFUZZ在处理多目标站点时比DirectFuzz扩展性好30倍，覆盖率提高11.66%，运行速度快2.76倍。

Conclusion: PROFUZZ在复杂硬件系统中具有出色的可扩展性和有效性，为硬件安全验证提供了更高效的定向模糊测试解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware Fuzzing emerged as one of the crucial techniques for finding
security flaws in modern hardware designs by testing a wide range of input
scenarios. One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that
maximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF)
methods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on
specific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF)
techniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but
it has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description
languages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with
abstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel
framework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with
Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By
leveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate
precise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while
maintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales
30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves
coverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and
effectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems.

Result: 仿真结果验证了SS-ISAC框架在感知通信性能和窃听预防方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SS-ISAC框架提供了一种灵活且有效的安全防护方案，能够在保证系统性能的同时防止窃听威胁。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, continuous interaction among a
large number of devices generates complex and dynamic network traffic, which
poses significant challenges to rule-based detection approaches. Machine
learning (ML)-based traffic detection technology, capable of identifying
anomalous patterns and potential threats within this traffic, serves as a
critical component in ensuring network security. This study first identifies a
significant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g.,
CICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to
high sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing
traffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of
efficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of
network traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature
extraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor
of context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving
the generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training
framework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a
contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic
representations of traffic. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on
the real-world Mawi data set to validate the proposed method in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Comparative experiments
against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models demonstrate the superior
performance of our approach. Furthermore, we confirm its applicability and
deployability in real-time scenarios.

Abstract: The mapping $\chi_n$ from $\F_{2}^{n}$ to itself defined by $y=\chi_n(x)$
with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+2}(1+x_{i+1})$, where the indices are computed modulo $n$,
has been widely studied for its applications in lightweight cryptography.
However, $\chi_n $ is bijective on $\F_2^n$ only when $n$ is odd, restricting
its use to odd-dimensional vector spaces over $\F_2$. To address this
limitation, we introduce and analyze the generalized mapping $\chi_{n, m}$
defined by $y=\chi_{n,m}(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+m} (x_{i+m-1}+1)(x_{i+m-2}+1)
\cdots (x_{i+1}+1)$, where $m$ is a fixed integer with $m\nmid n$. To
investigate such mappings, we further generalize $\chi_{n,m}$ to $\theta_{m,
k}$, where $\theta_{m, k}$ is given by $y_i=x_{i+mk} \prod_{\substack{j=1,\,\,
m \nmid j}}^{mk-1} \left(x_{i+j}+1\right), \,\,{\rm for }\,\, i\in
\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We prove that these mappings generate an abelian group
isomorphic to the group of units in $\F_2[z]/(z^{\lfloor n/m\rfloor +1})$. This
structural insight enables us to construct a broad class of permutations over
$\F_2^n$ for any positive integer $n$, along with their inverses. We rigorously
analyze algebraic properties of these mappings, including their iterations,
fixed points, and cycle structures. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive
database of the cryptographic properties for iterates of $\chi_{n,m}$ for small
values of $n$ and $m$. Finally, we conduct a comparative security and
implementation cost analysis among $\chi_{n,m}$, $\chi_n$, $\chi\chi_n$
(EUROCRYPT 2025 \cite{belkheyar2025chi}) and their variants, and prove
Conjecture~1 proposed in~\cite{belkheyar2025chi} as a by-product of our study.
Our results lead to generalizations of $\chi_n$, providing alternatives to
$\chi_n$ and $\chi\chi_n$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AutoMalTool框架，用于自动化生成恶意MCP工具来测试LLM智能体的安全性，揭示了MCP工具中毒攻击的新安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体的广泛应用，MCP工具已成为标准交互协议，但其引入的工具中毒攻击风险尚未得到系统性研究。现有红队测试方法仍停留在概念验证阶段，缺乏自动化和系统性的测试框架。

Method: 开发了AutoMalTool自动化红队测试框架，专门针对MCP工具中毒场景生成恶意工具，能够绕过现有检测机制。

Result: 评估显示AutoMalTool能有效生成恶意MCP工具，成功操纵主流LLM智能体的行为，同时规避检测。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM智能体在MCP工具范式下的新安全风险，为安全防护提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应鲁棒性半径作为衡量水印鲁棒性的正式指标，并开发了基于强化学习的RLCracker攻击方法，能够在仅使用少量水印样本且无需访问检测器的情况下，有效移除多种水印方案的水印，揭示了当前水印技术的严重安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印评估方法对抗性不足，掩盖了关键漏洞并高估了安全性。作者认为需要更严格的对抗性评估来真实反映水印技术的安全性。

Method: 提出自适应鲁棒性半径理论框架，并开发RLCracker——一种基于强化学习的自适应攻击方法，通过优化攻击上下文和模型参数来移除水印。

Result: RLCracker仅使用100个短样本训练3B模型，就能在1500个标记的Unigram水印文本上实现98.5%的移除成功率，平均P-SP得分0.92，远超GPT-4o的6.75%成功率，并在10种水印方案和5种模型规模上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 自适应攻击对当前水印防御构成根本性威胁，现有水印技术在对抗性攻击面前存在严重安全漏洞。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) watermarking has shown promise in detecting
AI-generated content and mitigating misuse, with prior work claiming robustness
against paraphrasing and text editing. In this paper, we argue that existing
evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical
vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce
adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark
resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing
the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius,
making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this
insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive
attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker
requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector.
Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal
success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts
after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds
6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking
schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and
pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

Motivation: 传统钓鱼检测方法仅孤立分析邮件内容或URL，无法全面应对日益复杂的钓鱼攻击威胁

Method: 使用微调的DistilBERT进行语义分析，结合字符级TF-IDF向量化和随机森林进行链接结构分析的双路径框架

Result: DistilBERT在文本检测上达到准确率与计算效率的近乎最优平衡，随机森林在恶意URL识别上显著优于其他分类器

Conclusion: 双路径方法具有高效性、实用价值和可扩展性，能够增强邮件安全对抗现代钓鱼威胁

Abstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

Method: 提出代理函数框架，通过动态估计句子代理函数中位数并施加多重约束通道来嵌入水印，同时提供理论保证。

Result: 实验表明PMark在文本质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有基线方法，特别是在抗改写攻击方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PMark为检测机器生成文本提供了更有效的范式，具有理论保证和无失真特性。

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at

We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,
offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

### [48] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，能够系统性地检测基于LLM的代理系统中的错误，重点关注代理动作序列而非具体文本输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在面对LLM自然语言输出的变异性时显得脆弱，需要一种能够独立于具体文本内容来验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，通过监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，使用时序表达式捕获正确的行为模式。

Result: 在三代理系统测试中，使用大型模型时所有时序断言都得到满足，而使用较小模型时出现行为违规，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败，时序表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别是在关键应用部署中检测行为回归方面具有有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LATTS（局部自适应测试时缩放）的方法，通过在每个生成步骤中动态调整计算资源分配，提高大型语言模型在下游任务中的性能效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的验证器方法在测试时均匀增加计算资源，不考虑不同样本和生成步骤的复杂性差异，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS在每个生成步骤使用验证器模型的接受标准来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型提供的局部难度概念动态调整计算资源。

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准的基于验证器的方法，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了显著更优的权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配策略，有效解决了现有方法计算资源分配不均的问题，为测试时缩放提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: 该工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，支持在动态不确定环境下的可靠实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Conclusion: 通过实时训练持续优化AI推理，系统保持灵活性，能够满足不断变化的需求，确保大规模安全关键环境中的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE是一个基于多级反思合成的自学习智能体框架，通过三个互补层级的反思（微观、中观、宏观）来提升LLM智能体的反思能力，在复杂任务中显著优于现有反思基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在复杂任务中面临反思能力不足的挑战，主要由于错误分析不充分和过度依赖少数成功轨迹，需要更系统的反思机制来提升性能。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，包含三个层级的反思合成：单轨迹学习（微观级）进行详细错误修正；任务内学习（中观级）构建错误分类法；任务间学习（宏观级）提取可迁移见解。通过微调语言模型作为反思模型，并扩展到交互式设置的前瞻反思机制。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个挑战性基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自改进LLM智能体中起着关键作用，SAMULE框架为智能体的自我学习能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware

agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Method: 构建多协议数据集和知识库，集成检索引擎、百分位预测组件和临床约束检查器，使用多步提示驱动推理管道

Result: 优化后的检索配置实现完美最近邻准确率（5百分位点内）和低于2点的MAE，端到端系统与独立模块计算结果100%一致

Conclusion: 该系统展示了结合结构化群体评分与模块化工具增强推理的可行性，提供可追溯输出并最小化幻觉，未来将进行临床验证和改进领域适应检索模型

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习来解决现有方法在多样化应用界面和用户需求变化中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理中表现不佳，特别是在处理长尾应用和用户交互时，端到端方法依赖模型常识往往失败，而无用户交互的代理会单方面行动损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：(i)全局任务规划器从跨应用视角分解用户任务；(ii)应用级执行器基于长短期记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心代理在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；(iii)自学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Result: 实验显示，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前最先进方法，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制，在真实移动场景中显著提升了代理性能，证明了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型推理速度慢，NAR模型输出质量低，需要结合两者优势来解决数学和代码等推理密集型任务中的效率与质量平衡问题

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后让AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案

Result: 实验显示该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本

Conclusion: 该集成框架成功结合了AR和NAR模型的优势，为推理任务提供了高效且高质量的解决方案

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Motivation: 解决机器人在复杂环境中有效存储观察结果作为记忆，并利用这些记忆回答人类关于空间位置查询的关键研究挑战。现有研究在构建机器人记忆方面取得进展，但缺乏高效的记忆检索和整合机制。

Method: Meta-Memory是一个LLM驱动的智能体，构建环境的高密度记忆表示。其核心创新在于能够通过语义和空间模态的联合推理来检索和整合相关记忆。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA数据集和公开NaVQA基准测试中，Meta-Memory显著优于最先进方法。在真实机器人平台上成功部署，展示了其在复杂环境中的实用性。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大准确的空间推理能力，通过创新的记忆检索和整合机制，有效解决了机器人空间记忆管理的挑战。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个粗到细的推理增强框架，旨在让LLM能够像专家一样进行日志分析推理，通过两阶段增强方法显著提升LLM在日志分析任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM在日志分析任务中难以构建与专家认知一致的结构化推理流程，且无法提供详细的推理步骤细节，这限制了其在系统监控和故障诊断中的应用。

Method: LogReasoner包含两个阶段：(1)粗粒度专家思维增强：从故障排除流程图构建高层专家思维，使LLM能制定结构化推理流程；(2)细粒度具体步骤增强：先通过任务特定逐步解决方案微调LLM，然后使用偏好学习从错误中校准推理细节。

Result: 在四个不同日志分析任务上的实验表明，LogReasoner显著优于现有LLM，在Qwen-2.5和Llama-3等开源模型上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架在提升LLM分析粒度和正确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto框架通过反事实推理有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Motivation: 现有方法在整合多组学数据、拓扑结构和文本知识方面存在局限，无法实现可解释的机制推理，需要一种能够结合数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文的新方法。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型引导的强化学习，将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以逐步生成疾病相关子图，实现过程级监督。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准测试，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学图谱和生物医学图知识，支持长上下文推理和可扩展的生物基础框架。

Conclusion: GALAX为精准医学提供了可靠、可解释的靶点和通路发现方法，通过强化引导的子图推理实现了数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文的有机整合。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确、鲁棒和可操作的解决方案，能够更好地理解复杂评论内容。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Method: 通过原子级映射生成的完整合成路径到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数就能达到竞争性的解决率

Conclusion: AOT*框架通过结合LLM推理能力和系统化树搜索，显著提升了反合成规划的效率和可扩展性

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理的行为进行原则性评估，提供比传统方法更全面和细致的性能分析。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长上下文科学推理方面的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要的评估基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体决策过程在知识图谱上构建上下文，在保证准确性的同时控制延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示往往过度检索、增加上下文大小且运行时间不可预测，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人）和LC-MAPPO算法，将上下文构建建模为序列决策过程，在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架无法评估AI系统特别是大型语言模型在科学创意生成等创造性任务中的表现，需要建立专门针对开放性和创造性的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于新颖性和实用性的理论评估框架，通过实验分析不同模型规模（深度和宽度）对创造性能力的影响，并研究创意生成与可行性执行之间的差距。

Result: 发现创造性能力存在最优模型深度和宽度；存在新颖性与实用性的基本权衡关系；即使模型规模扩大，这种权衡关系依然存在。

Conclusion: 当前形式的大型语言模型在长期创造性潜力方面存在局限性，需要新的方法来改进AI模型的创造性能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在解决真实世界网页上的多轮、长时程任务时，存在行动序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要一种能够自我进化的智能体框架来提高性能。

Method: 提出Recon-Act框架，包含侦察团队和行动团队：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队处理意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误与成功轨迹，侦察团队推断补救措施并抽象为通用工具，实时注册到工具库中。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，有效解决了多轮网页任务中的行动序列问题，展示了自我进化框架的潜力。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估器的框架存在严重的不一致性问题：分数比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中胜过高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: TrustJudge框架包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致率从23.32%降低到14.89%（降低8.43%），成对传递不一致率从15.22%降低到4.40%（降低10.82%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Motivation: 当前方法对思维链数据使用不加区分，缺乏对哪些数据类型能最有效提升模型推理能力的理解。需要系统性地识别和利用高价值推理模式来扩展模型的推理潜力。

Method: 1) 定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数；2) 从思维链序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式；3) 提出基于推理模式链和token熵的双粒度算法，从数据池中选择高价值思维链数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的高价值思维链数据，就能使850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升9.58%，并将下游强化学习性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过系统识别和利用高价值推理模式，可以显著提升大型推理模型的数学推理能力，证明了数据质量比数量更重要，为高效训练推理模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析框架，从推理路径的角度研究强化学习和监督微调如何塑造大语言模型的推理能力，发现RL压缩错误轨迹而SFT扩展正确轨迹，RL集中推理功能而SFT均匀分布推理功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型通常通过强化学习和监督微调来提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体影响推理过程仍不清楚。论文旨在超越简单的准确率分析，深入理解这两种训练方法如何塑造推理过程。

Method: 引入新的分析框架，在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级（完整推理输出）和步骤级（推理图节点）两个粒度分析推理过程，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度和中介中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，SFT将其减少到约三分之一；RL将推理功能集中在少数步骤，SFT将其均匀分布在多个步骤。

Conclusion: 该研究解释了为什么当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练是最佳实践，为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实际指导，展示了推理路径分析框架的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽略了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性。当前强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑他人策略，需要解决战略决策中的策略感知问题。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法：1)基于推理他人策略生成rollouts；2)在图级和样本级进行优势估计；3)平衡全局和局部奖励。算法优化对他人策略和游戏态势趋势的感知能力。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面提升35%。与参数规模大100倍的模型相比，仍有18%的性能提升。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了LLM的战略决策能力，证明了在复杂决策场景中考虑策略相互依赖性的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和动作执行视为独立任务，忽略了镜像神经元揭示的这两种能力之间的内在联系。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习强制对齐对应表示，最大化它们的互信息。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的相互协同，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以更好地模拟镜像神经元机制，实现动作理解和执行能力的统一建模。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLM的单次推理输出容量有限，当任务复杂度超过模型容量时，准确性会崩溃。

Method: 提出InfoQA多调用框架，结合容量感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前推理痕迹，保持信息负载在单次推理限制内，并通过依赖显式工作流程实现精确控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论指导，InfoQA框架有效解决了单次推理容量限制问题。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以平衡预测准确性和解释透明性，要么准确但解释不清晰，要么解释流畅但统计支持不足。这源于对数据的浅层交互，无法形成类似人类专家的深度理解。

Method: 提出RCA框架，包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理）。通过预测准确性驱动更深层次理解，构建强大的数据内部模型。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，与22个基线方法比较。RCA不仅达到最先进的准确性和鲁棒性（相对改进高达40%），更重要的是能够生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据且平衡的解释。

Conclusion: 高准确性和高质量解释不是分离的目标，而是模型对数据形成深度直接理解的相互强化结果。RCA展示了创建真正可信赖临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）评估嵌入模型和相似性度量，在30+数据集上发现现有方法存在显著性能差距和关键权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现强劲，迫切需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30多个数据集上通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细微人类判断任务来评估语义理解能力。

Result: 评估了9个嵌入模型和经典度量方法，发现性能存在显著差距：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性上被Jaccard相似性（0.905）显著超越；text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
